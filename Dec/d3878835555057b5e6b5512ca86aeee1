Women are encouraged to comply with the officers and stop and remain inside their vehicle but immediately request to see an appointment card. "If they do not have an appointment card then they are not an officer, I would suggest that you call for help immediately," he explained. Social media has seen several incidents of women driving alone at night, opting to stop at the nearest garage or visible location while being pulled over by the police. A recent incident in Tshwane saw awoman allegedly being manhandled by a number of Tshwane Metro Police Department officers at a petrol station in Lyttleton. The woman feared the cops were not real and did not to pull over. She instead opted to drive to a nearby petrol station, where the officers proceeded to allegedly manhandle her. In incidents of this nature, Minnaar could not clarify whether - in light of this country's social climate of violence against women and children - this action was justifiable or not. "Look,it's about obeying the rules of the road and that is for everyone - male or female. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-banner-1','ezslot_7',116,'0','0']));"Officers may apply their discretion in these situations, but an officer can stop you legally," he explained. Women must remember the following if a police stop escalates to a search: - A male or female officer is permitted to stop you and request your driver's licence and car registration. - If you are pulled over and the officer decides to undertake a search, only a female officer is permitted to proceed with such an action. - If a female officer is not present, the motorist must request the male officer to call a female officer (with an appointment card) to the scene then the action may proceed. - The absence of a female officer does not mean that you may be let go. - If you feel your safety is compromised, a female motorist is allowed to remain in the vehicle until a female officer arrives at the scene. - It is up to you to report a case to the police if you find an officer operating without an appointment card. - A female motorist is also afforded the right to call for help when her safety is at risk. "It is up to you as an individual to report the case to the police station. It is easy to verify an officer through an appointment card. If the officer evades that, you can take the van's vehicle registration number," acting station commander Nalini Singh previously told News24.
