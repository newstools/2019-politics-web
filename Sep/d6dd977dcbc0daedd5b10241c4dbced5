ANC in Gauteng plans to raise Income Tax to pay for e-tolls 30 August 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng has reliably learnt (among other proposals) that the ANC in the province wants to raise Income Tax in order to pay for e-tolls. This is unacceptable and will place further strain on our already overburdened residents, who are already struggling with the high cost of living. In addition to this, residents will also be taxed further in order to pay for the proposed National Health Insurance Fund that government wants to implement. The DA has been against the implementation of e-tolls since its inception, as it is an unfair tax burden on our residents who are struggling to make ends meet. Furthermore, motorists are at risk of infringing the Administrative Adjudication of Road Traffic Offices Amendment Act for not paying their e-tolls. While truck drivers are at risk of losing their licence as they will be fined R500 and one demerit point, for every gantry they pass without paying e-tolls. The Minister of Transport, Fikile Mbalula was expected to make an announcement on e-tolls yesterday, but we are still waiting to hear what the resolution on the matter is. It is clear that the ANC has no intention of getting rid of e-tolls and that residents in Gauteng will continue to pay for something they do not want. The DA will continue to call on Premier David Makhura to launch an inter-governmental dispute on e-tolls and instead the fuel levy should be used to replace e-tolls and not bale out SOEs.
