DA calls for computerised hospital files to cut queues 30 July 2019 DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC Jack Bloom called for a health information system and computerized hospital files in the debate today in the Gauteng Legislature on the R50.8 billion Gauteng Health Budget. Excerpts from his speech as follows: “MEC Bandile Masuku, one of your priorities should be to install a health information system so that you can assess how the budget is being spent. Without it, you are largely flying blind. You can’t determine where there are inefficiencies and where best to direct resources. One of the sins of the past was the promise by former Health MEC Brian Hlongwa 12 years ago that there would be a health smart card for patients and a proper health information system. Both of these proposals stalled because of massive corruption for which nobody has yet gone to jail. I remember the first Health MEC Amos Masondo promising a health information system. I hope that you are the one who can finally deliver this. It is high time that paper files were replaced with electronic patient records. There have been many failed promises in this House about this, it is time it actually happened. The department needs to use technology to cut queues and waiting times. It is unconscionable that sick and elderly people arrive in the early morning because they are desperate to receive treatment without spending a whole day at the hospital or come back the next day as well.” Issued by Jack Bloom, DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC, 30 July 2019
