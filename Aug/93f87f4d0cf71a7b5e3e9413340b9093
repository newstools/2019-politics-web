#HandsoffMashaba: Mashaba creates thousands of jobs 20 August 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) applauds Mayor Herman Mashaba’s decision to bring an end to politically connected companies in the DA-led City of Johannesburg by directly hiring cleaners and guards. More than 1 879 cleaners, who previously earned R3000, will now earn R5600 and security guards who earned less than R4000 will now earn R7400 as part of Mayor Mashaba’s employment programme. Under the previous ANC-led administration, security and cleaning jobs were not a priority as they were too busy feeding themselves. Monies that were directed to connected politicians through exorbitant tenders, will now go to the poor and that is making the ANC angry. That is why they are fielding another frivolous Motion of No Confidence in Mayor Mashaba. ANC corruption has caused our people to suffer, with decent jobs only going to a connected few. Similarly, Mayor Mashaba has created conditions upon which 44 000 Expanded Public Works Programme (EPWP) job opportunities can be created to ensure that ordinary people have food on the table. It is time that the ANC allows the Mayor get on with bringing change to the people of Johannesburg by creating much needed jobs. The DA calls on the people of Johannesburg to view and sign the petition below to allow Mayor Mashaba to put their needs first. https://www.handsoffmashaba.co.za Only the DA can bring change that builds One South Africa for All.
