NPA confirms prosecution of Malema thanks to continuous pressure by AfriForum 9 October 2019 AfriForum received written confirmation this afternoon that Julius Malema will indeed be prosecuted by the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) on charges against him after he fired off shots during the EFF’s five-year festivities in 2018 using an object that looked like an assault rifle.eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0'])); This follows after AfriForum continuously placed pressure on the NPA, among others for feedback on the NPA’s decision surrounding Malema’s prosecution. AfriForum was prepared to approach the court in order to force the NPA to make a decision regarding Malema’s prosecution. After AfriForum submitted these charges against Malema, the EFF’s Spokespersons denied that the object under discussion was a real firearm and later claimed that it allegedly was crackers that went off in rhythm with the object. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));“We welcome the NPA’s decision seeing as no-one must be considered to be above the law. AfriForum will continuously monitor the matter to ensure that justice prevails,” says Ian Cameron, AfriForum’s Head of Community Safety.
