Mabuza indicates new direction for government concerning power generation 17 October 2019 The FF Plus welcomes deputy president David Mabuza's view of independent power suppliers and the role that they can play in the country.

He said that the country's ability to generate power has decreased due to the age of power plants. He then mentioned independent power generators as a source that could help make up the deficits so as to stabilise the country's power supply.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0'])); This is a very important change in direction from the government's side â€“ a change that the FF Plus has been advocating for quite some time now.
