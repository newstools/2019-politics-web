GANGSTER STATE: WE WILL NOT BUCKLE UNDER POLITICAL PRESSURE We note the ANC’s press statement in response to Pieter-Louis Myburgh’s new book, Gangster State. The statement is replete with stock phrases like ‘Stratcom’, ‘fake news’, ‘white monopoly capital’ and ‘reactionary forces’. That there has been no attempt to substantively refute the allegations in the book speaks volumes. The ANC has recently stated that it will act in the public interest, and hold leaders who loot accountable for their actions. This is a chance to turn words into deeds. We further note Mr Magashule’s threats to pursue legal action over the contents of the book. We will oppose any legal action that seeks to hide essential facts from South Africans about how our government is really being run. It is important that individuals and organisations are not intimidated by powerful people with deep pockets who cannot tolerate these truths being laid bare. Whatever the ANC and Mr Magashule decide, Penguin Random House stands by the book and its author. Gangster State was meticulously researched and thoroughly checked by our legal team. The book tells an important part of the state capture story clearly and compellingly. We will not withdraw it – or any of its contents – under political pressure. Issued by Surita Joubert on behalf of PRHSA, 2 April 2019
