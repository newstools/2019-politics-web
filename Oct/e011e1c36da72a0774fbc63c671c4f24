3832 deaths in Gauteng hospitals because of medical negligence 30 October 2019 3832 patients died last year in Gauteng public hospitals as a result of 10 741 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), which largely arise from avoidable medical negligence. This shocking information was disclosed by Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku in a written reply to my questions in the Gauteng Legislature. A SAE is defined as an event that results in an unintended harm to the patient by an act of commission or omission rather than by the underlying disease or condition of the patient. Hospitals with the most recorded SAEs are as follows: Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital 1763 Steve Biko Hospital 893 George Mukhari Hospital 766 Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Hospital 722 Helen Joseph Hospital 644 Thelle Mogoerane Hospital 625 Tembisa Hospital 517 Sebokeng Hospital 511 Weskoppies Hospital 504 Kopanong Hospital 415 Bertha Gxowa Hospital 409 Tambo Memorial Hospital 393 Rahima Moosa Hospital 385 Kalafong Hospital 345 Leratong Hospital 323 I am most concerned by the 2307 recorded deaths of newborn babies and 238 maternal deaths. There were also 866 Septic Caesarean Sections and 1148 cases of Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy which causes brain damage to children deprived of oxygen. Another indication of poor care is the 1052 cases of hospital-acquired pressure sores which are reported as SAEs “as they have direct impact on the patient’s average length of stay in hospital, increase cost of treatment and may lead to body disfigurement.” Despite the high number of SAEs only 77 cases were referred for disciplinary action. These figures are highly disturbing. They highlight severe management problems in public hospitals and lack of consequence for medical mistakes which leads to court cases and huge payouts that drain the health budget. This is further evidence of public sector incompetence that would doom the proposed National Health Insurance (NHI) which is administratively very complex.
