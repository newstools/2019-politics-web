DA Gauteng Premier Candidate Msimanga unveils fair access to jobs plan 25 April 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) Gauteng Premier Candidate, Solly Msimanga unveiled his lottery-for-jobs plan to ensure fair access to EPWP job opportunities across the province that he will implement when elected to govern on 8 May 2019. A lottery system is a proven remedy for one of the significant failures of the current ANC administration – providing fair access to jobs. This great initiative will replace the current corrupt system which only benefits ANC-connected individuals. Under the ANC-led Gauteng government, EPWP job opportunities are only for ANC-card carrying members, while the majority of our people are denied opportunities. This alternative system will ensure that everyone will have an equal chance of getting a job. If you are putting in an honest day’s work, then the least government can do is give you the job honestly. Too often we hear of women who are pressured to provide sexual favours in order to get jobs. This is not only a corrupt practice but also a serious offence. The perpetrators must be arrested and sent to jail. The lottery system is free from political manipulation and creates fair access to jobs. The DA will strive to ensure a job in every home. Msimanga instituted the fair and equitable lottery system while he was Mayor of Tshwane which has worked for several years now. It is high time that the province replicates such a good practice. Gauteng residents have lost trust in government’s ability to provide fair access to employment opportunities. The dream of a prosperous and free South Africa is slipping between our fingers because of the corrupt ANC leadership. Issued by Solly Msimanga, DA Gauteng Premier Candidate, 25 April 2019
