Top ranking a win for people of Joburg 6 September 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) applauds the announcement by National Treasury, ranking the DA-led City of Johannesburg as top metro in revenue collection and expenditure. This is a win for the people of Joburg and shows what our hard work and dedication can deliver. The city ranked first at 98.5% of budgeted revenue and second in terms of expenditure at 97.5%. This is further evidence that in working with the people of this amazing city, Mayor Mashaba has brought the city's finances back on track by increasing revenue, attracting billions in investment and cutting ANC corruption. When the DA took over the City of Jo'burg from the ANC three years ago, it was in a financial mess with 19% of the budget stolen through corruption. And it was the people who were suffering. Today, we see that the change is starting to take effect. I want to commend Mayor Mashaba and his team, but most of all, I want to commend the people of Johannesburg. We have a lot of work ahead but we have done good work up to this point and we could not have come this far without the support and help of the people.
