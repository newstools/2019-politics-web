African National Congress applies to cross-examine Angelo Agrizzi 29 March 2019 The African National Congress (ANC) has applied to cross-examine Mr Angelo Agrizzi who testified before the Zondo Commission on Thursday, 28 March 2019. In his evidence, Mr Agrizzi leveled a number of allegations against the ANC and its leadership. The leadership of the ANC has publicly stated that it will, at an appropriate time, present itself to the Commission where the ANC will make a full submission that will answer all allegations tabled against it. However, Mr Agrgrizi's testimony cannot be left unchallenged. We, therefore, cannot wait for a comprehensive submission to the Commission. We are confident that the Commission will be able to afford the ANC the opportunity to cross-examine Mr Agrizzi on his allegations.
