Some Gauteng doctors still not paid 7 February 2019 Despite promises that all interns and community service doctors at Gauteng hospitals would be paid their January salaries by today at the latest, some doctors have received “courtesy” calls that this will not happen. Only 552 out of 1378 junior doctors were paid by 31 January, and some were placed on special leave as they could not even pay for their transport and food. Other doctors have borrowed money to get by, causing great distress as debit orders have been rejected. Junior doctors at the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Hospital have been badly affected, and refused to work last weekend. This is inexcusable treatment of medical professionals who started their first jobs this year. The Gauteng Health Department claims that the problem was caused by the late creation of posts, but this is a poor excuse. It is yet another indication that the ANC in Gauteng is failing to fix the deep-seated problems in this Department which has been plagued by corruption and mismanagement.
