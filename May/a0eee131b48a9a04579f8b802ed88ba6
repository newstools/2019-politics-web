ANC urges Human Rights Commission to urgently follow up Commissioner Nissen’s recommendations about DOL 26 May 2019 ANC provincial secretary Faiez Jacobs has urged the Human Rights Commission to follow up a recommendation from one of its Commissioners, the Reverend Chris Nissen, for an urgent investigation into the employment practices of the Department of Labour in the Western Cape. Rev Nissen made the recommendation after following up a request by Comrade Jacobs that the HRC should facilitate a meeting between the civil society group, Gatvol Capetonians, and the Department. Rev Nissen said in his report that the background to his probe was that Coloured people in Mitchells Plain complained that they were being overlooked by DOL when it came to employment opportunities. Organizations, such as Gatvol Capetonians, had taken up these complaints. The ANC subsequently asked Rev Nissen to take a look at the situation, which he did. Rev Nissen was not satisfied with DOL’s practices. He stated in his report that by employing 46 people from one group it had undermined the rights of others in Mitchells Plain in an act that constituted an alleged human rights violation. “So the saga continues, hence my recommendation that an investigation into the Western Cape Labour Department be undertaken by the SAHRC as a matter of urgency,” Rev Nissen said in his report. ANC Jacobs said he was concerned about Rev Nissen’s findings and urged the SAHRC to act speedily on his recommendations. “The situation calls for urgent attention. Only appointing people from one group in an area such as Mitchells Plain causes racial tension and undermines social cohesion,” Jacobs said.
