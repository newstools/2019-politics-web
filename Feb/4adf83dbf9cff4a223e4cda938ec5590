Centurion residents: Hands off our land 20 February 2019 Over 500 members of the community met at Leriba Lodge in Centurion, Pretoria, last night to give a formal mandate to AfriForum to oppose the residential land claim in Centurion. This follows after a land claim was published in the Government Gazette in June 2018, which affects approximately 4 000 hectare of immovable property and involves close to 2 000 households. AfriForum announced its 13-point plan during this meeting and will launch various other actions to support the community in the battle of opposing this land claim. This includes getting legal aid to oppose the claim. “AfriForum became a party to the case because the property rights of hundreds of property owners – who worked hard for what they have – is threatened by a land claim without merit. Politicians have created unrealistic expectations with their supporters regarding land and AfriForum will definitely not stand back and watch as legal land owners pay the price for this. We will oppose this unfounded land claim with all mechanisms at our disposal,” says Kallie Kriel, CEO at AfriForum. AfriForum has directed a request to the relevant commission to ask for an extension to deliver presentations against the said claim. Full and closer details regarding this claim was also requested. “As civil rights watchdog, AfriForum will continue to fight the battle for the protection of property rights. We will continue to support communities and provide advice in this matter. Owners cannot be deprived of their property – which was legally obtained – due to greed,” says Ian Cameron, Head of Community Safety at AfriForum.
