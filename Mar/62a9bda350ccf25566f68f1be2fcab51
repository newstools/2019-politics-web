THE EFF WELCOMES THE JUDGEMENT ON THE COLIGNY MURDER Wednesday, 6 March, 2019 The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) welcomes the judgement passed by Judge Ronnie Hendricks at the North West High Court sentencing Pieter Doorewaard and Philip Schutte to an effective 18 and 23 years respectively for murder, kidnapping and intimidation of young Matlhomola Moshoeu. We welcome this verdict as a step towards the direction of changing the repulsive and barbaric attitude that racist white people have towards black people, believing that they can take our lives without being held accountable. Though the verdict will not bring back the lost life but we are please that justice was served for the Moshoeu family. May the soul of the Matlhomola Moshoeu and may history never forget the brutal manner this young man was killed, so that our cries for economic emancipation may only be silenced by total liberation of black child. Statement issued by the Economic Freedom Fighters, 6 March 2019
