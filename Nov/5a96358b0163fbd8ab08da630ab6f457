Increased water consumption continues 25 November 2019 Cape Town’s water consumption has increased by 39 million litres/day for the past week (18-24 November) reaching 689 million litres/day. The daily allocation is 650 million litres/day. The collective metro dam levels have dropped by 0,6% over the previous week, and are currently at 83,1%. As the memory of our close call with Day Zero fades, and consumption edges upwards towards normal levels, we request residents to please keep in mind that rainfall this past winter was below average for the fifth consecutive year. ‘Although these recent increases to water consumption are not yet of significant concern to the City, we can’t be certain of the rainfall in the current and next hydrological year and those thereafter. We need to continue with our water-wise habits and remain mindful of our consumption,’ said the City’s Mayoral Committee Member for Water and Waste, Alderman Xanthea Limberg. ‘Over the current hydrological year (which started from 1 November to 31 October), residents should please keep an eye out for updates to restriction levels and respond appropriately if the City announces it is necessary to reduce water use,’ said Alderman Limberg.
