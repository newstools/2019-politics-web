Veterans and senior citizens of African National Congress declaration after the all-inclusive elections workshop 28 March 2019 We the undersigned are long serving stalwarts and veterans of the African National Congress, with  more than 40 years of unbroken service,support and reiterate the call of the Gauteng all-inclusive meeting of veterans and senior citizens of the African National Congress, on 12 March 2019, that, in consideration of the candidates to represent the ANC in the National Assembly and the Provincial Legislature(s) the candidates should be “the women and men who we will look up to, the leaders who stand out for their track records, experience and commitment, who must ensure that we grow our country for the benefit of all.” And that “In accepting their nominations we urge them to carefully introspect.  We urge them to step aside if their nomination may be negatively perceived by the electorate and if in any way they are undeserving of the confidence of the electorate.” We have learnt that the lists include individuals who may affect the confidence of the electorate in the ANC and we call on the President, in terms of Section 16.1.3 of the ANC Constitution to, with the support of the Officials, the NWC and the NEC, take the following steps during the vetting process of the IEC: - Immediately refer the lists of candidates to the Integrity Commission, to allow it to interact with comrades whose nomination may be negatively perceived, irrespective of whether or not the legal process pertaining to them has been completed, and, if appropriate, request such comrades to step aside - Together with the officials, call in all candidates on the list who have been implicated in the different Commissions to request them, irrespective of whether or not the legal processes pertaining to them have been completed, in the interests of the credibility of the ANC list, to step aside. In the event that the affected individuals don’t find it within their conscience to step aside our submission is that they should never be considered for any responsibilty in parliament and legislatures and the Executive  arm of government.
