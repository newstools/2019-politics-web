Long delay in completing new psychiatric wards at Helen Joseph Hospital 13 June 2019 The Democratic Alliance welcomes the announcement by Infrastructure Development MEC Tasneem Motara that the first wing of the new psychiatric wards at the Helen Joseph Hospital will be completed next week, but this is nearly three years overdue. The renovation of the two 20-bed psychiatric wards started in November 2014, and was supposed to be done by August 2016. Former Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa promised that it would be completed before March this year. Meanwhile, mental patients have suffered in sub-standard facilities and the second 20-bed ward is further delayed as well. It is appalling thatÂ mental health patients are still treated badly in Gauteng even after the Life Esidimeni tragedy. I hope that MEC Motara takes firm steps to ensure that her department delivers future hospital projects on time and within budget. Issued by Jack Bloom MPL, DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC, 13 June 2019
