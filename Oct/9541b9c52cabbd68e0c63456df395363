EFF calls on Mantashe to step down as Minister and MP following allegations of bribing journalists 29 October 2019 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));The EFF is deeply concerned about allegations that Minister Gwede Mantashe has bribed Sunday World journalists in exchange for them not to write scandalous stories about him. The Sunday World reported that Mantashe confessed in an interview that he paid R70 000 to journalists in an attempt to stop them from writing a scandalous story about him. As the EFF we believe these allegations may be true and call on Mantashe to step down as Minister and Member of Parliament for engaging in unethical and corrupt relations with the media. He is not different to Apartheid StratCom that compromised the independence and impartiality of the media by buying, bribing and infiltrating newsrooms and journalists. What Mantashe has done is dangerous for our democracy since it compromises the standing of the media in society. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0']));Yesterday, it was reported that Mantashe refuted claims that he confessed to bribing journalists. We call on Sunday World, for the sake of its own credibility, to release the evidence of Mantashe's confession on the bribery of journalists; whether it be an audio, video or written record. The Sunday World must do this not only for the sake of its credibility, but also for the credibility of media in general. The EFF has always warned that there are many journalists who are being bribed with brown envelopes by politicians to either play stories for them or not publish scandalous stories. Our democracy must act harshly against such shenanigans of defiling the independence of the media. Media must report without any favour and without any bias. It must not be open to bribery. And those found in violation of such ethics must be isolated and exposed. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2',114,'0','0']));Mantashe must step down, if he is bribing journalists to hide a sex story, we can only imagine what other corrupt activities he is involved in. A man willing to bribe journalists is capable of being bribed himself as a government official and member of the executive. He must step down with immediate effect.
