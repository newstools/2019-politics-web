OUTA disappointed that Jiba and Mrwebi remain advocates 27 June 2019 The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) is disappointed that the decision by the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) to keep former National Prosecution Authority (NPA) deputy Nomgcobo Jiba and her colleague, Lawrence Mrwebi on the roll of advocates will remain despite attempts by the General Council of the Bar of South Africa (GCB) to appeal it. “The Constitutional Court ruled that the matter does not fall within their jurisdiction and while we are disappointed that further action cannot be taken, we certainly understand that the law must be applied fairly and without prejudice in all circumstances,” said Adv. Stefanie Fick, OUTA’s Chief Legal Officer. “Having said that, Jiba and Mrwebi’s actions had a negative impact on the profession. It was under Jiba’s watch that the NPA was tarnished and state capture was allowed to flourish”. OUTA was among the first civil society movements to congratulate President Ramaphosa on axing Jiba and Mrwebi after a lengthy investigation into their fitness to hold their respective positions. The organisation now calls on the HAWKS and NPA to investigate Jiba and Mrwebi for any criminal activity that they may have been involved in. "The fight for justice continues and our state institutions need to make bold statements by pursuing high profile cases," added Fick. Issued by Lois Moodley, OUTA Head of Communications, 27 June 2019
