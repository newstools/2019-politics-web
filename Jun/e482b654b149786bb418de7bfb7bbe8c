AfriForum welcomes conviction, sentencing of farm attacker 6 June 2019 AfriForum welcomes the sentencing of Sebenzile Simane (32) in the Eastern Cape High Court in Port Elizabeth this morning. Simane was sentences to effectively 173 years in jail, after he was found guilty on 17 charges – among these attempted murder and rape – for the cold-blooded attack on a family in the Hankey District in the Eastern Cape. This follows a farm attack in 2018 during which a farmer’s wife was shot and raped by Simane in the presence of her underaged daughter. Simane will serve the sentence concurrently. “AfriForum welcomes the Court’s ruling, which condemned these types of sadistic and bloodthirsty attacks on farmers and their families. We trust that other courts will follow the example to drive home the seriousness of the wave of farm attacks that has the country in its grips, as well as for justice to triumph. It remains a feeble comfort, however, for the victims of attacks like this one, who must pick up the pieces of their lives and carry on. AfriForum will continue to support the victims of farm attacks in a bid to make the road to recovery easier,” says Marnus Kamfer, AfriForum’s Legal and Risk Manager for Community Safety.
