Independent investigation needed into case of decapitated baby 26 March 2019 I am horrified by the experience of a 19-year-old woman giving birth at the Tambo Memorial Hospital who reportedly watched as the baby’s head was detached from the body and then had to wait 24 hours for the rest of the body to be extracted. An independent investigation is needed as to why this case was not treated as an emergency and a Caesarian section performed. We also need to know what is being done about over-crowded conditions at the hospital’s 30-bed neonatal ward. Baby deaths at this ward increased alarmingly last year when expectant mothers were diverted there in large numbers because the neonatal ward at the Thelle Mogoerane Hospital in Vosloorus was closed after a Klebsiella outbreak. The public need to be assured that this ward is properly staffed and equipped, with quality care for all patients. Issued by Jack Bloom, DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC, 26 March 2019
