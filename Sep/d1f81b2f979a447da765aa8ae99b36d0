Bellville looting claims not true - Western Cape police 9 September 2019 Western Cape police denied there were any xenophobic attacks and looting in Bellville on Monday, putting it down to a brawl in a mall instead. "The situation was quickly resolved," saidÂ Brigadier Novela Potelwa amid jitters over the looting that occurred in Johannesburg and Tshwane. The argument was at the Middestad Mall. "Due to the location's close proximity to the Bellville taxi interchange, the incident was misconstrued to be an attack on businesses owned by foreign nationals in the area.eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0', 0])); "Currently, the situation remains calm in the Bellville CBD.
