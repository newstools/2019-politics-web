DA sends condolences to the family of the 16-year-old Mondeor High School pupil 13 March 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) sends its deepest condolences to the family of the 16 year-old Mondeor High School pupil who was stabbed and killed outside the school premises today. The details and causes of the incident are not yet known. The DA calls on both Gauteng Education MEC , Panyaza Lesufi and Gauteng Community Safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane to speedily investigate the death of this pupil and ensure that the perpetrators are brought to books. Furthermore, the Department of Education must provide trauma counseling to the learners and teachers at this school. Crime is rife in our communities and our people are no longer feeling safe walking alone on the streets. The criminals have taken over our streets while our police are doing nothing to ensure our citizens safety. The DA is the only party that has plans in place to ensure the safety and security of Gauteng’s residents. When we govern Gauteng in May 2019 we will ensure that we professionalise police services, equip them with resources and adequate personnel to fight crime and ensure the safety of our residents.
