Weâ€™re pulling baby carrier off shelves 9 January 2019 We met with Ubuntu Baba today and have completed our investigation into the allegations of copying. While there are differences in our baby carrier, there are striking similarities which we acknowledge and take responsibility for. This is not in line with our values and goes against the very clear policy and creative guidelines we have in place for our design process. This lapse in process is being addressed internally. We are intensifying and strengthening the training of our people, our suppliers and partners on our values-based approach to the design and sourcing process. We have sincerely apologised to Shannon personally and we would like to offer our heartfelt apologies to our customers who expect more from us. We are removing all product from our stores and online. Customers who wish to return their product may do so for a full refund. We remain deeply committed to the development of small businesses in South Africa. Issued by Woolworths, 9 January 2019
