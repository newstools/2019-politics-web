Both properties were furnished to the tune of R60 000. "I purchased furniture for the safe houses from a service provider in Benoni. In Mdluli's home, I purchased two beds, a lounge set, TV, and small appliances for the kitchen," Naidoo explained.

Naidoo was of the view that some of these properties were not fit for habitation. "Various properties were rented from Marimuthu, which cost about R200 000 to R250 000. This was relayed to me by [agent] FM08 who was in charge of these premises. "Both properties were in Umhlanga Rocks, Durban, close to Marimuthu's home. I felt it was unsuitable for occupation as one of the homes were generally unkept and the other was in a better condition but it was not ready; toilets were not working, etc.," he explained. Naidoo also referred to a beach home in KwaZulu-Natal that was used as a holiday spot for officials, as well as suppliers such as the owners of New World Motors and Atlantis Motors. "It is secluded, you can only get there with a 4x4 vehicle. Lazarus, myself and other confidants visited these premises, we would go there for holidays, school holidays, Christmas. Hence, state vehicles were used on these trips.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-banner-1','ezslot_5',116,'0','0'])); "I don't know what this house was officially supposed to be used for.
