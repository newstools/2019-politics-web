FF Plus strongly condemns Bonnievale farm attack 16 May 2019 The particulars of the farm attack that occurred earlier this week in Bonnievale in the Western Cape are disturbing and simultaneously also indicative of the fact that farm attacks were once a phenomenon that was unheard of in the Western Cape but, sadly, that is no longer the case. The incident occurred on Monday on the farm Kapteinsdrif near Bonnievale. Mr Tool Wessels (55) was murdered and his wife, Liezel, was seriously injured after she was, among other things, burnt with boiling water. Mr Wessels was also cruelly tortured before he was killed. The FF Plus strongly condemns this incident as well as every other murder and violent crime in South Africa where people are murdered or injured. It is absolutely unacceptable. The party expresses its sincerest condolences to the friends and family of the couple. The FF Plus has always considered farm attacks to be a very serious matter and will continue to put pressure on the government to prioritise this kind of crime. The party will also continue its campaign to inform the international community regarding farm attacks in South Africa. Issued by Corn√© Mulder, FF Plus provincial leader: Western Cape, 16 May 2019
