Lawlessness cannot be condoned 2 August 2019 The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Police, Ms Tina Joemat-Pettersson, has denounced the worrying acts of lawlessness in both the Cities of Tshwane and Johannesburg over the last week. The rule of law is the central pillar of any democracy and the committee is steadfast in its view that the South African Police Service together with Municipal policing structures must have collaborative plans in place to control such situations in future. Attacking officers of the law in downtown Johannesburg while they were busy with an operation targeting counterfeit goods must not be tolerated. “It is unacceptable that Johannesburg Metro Police Department and South African Police Services were stopped from doing their work as mandated by the law. SAPS and JMPD must go back into the area to successfully implement and conclude their operation,” said Ms Joemat-Pettersson. It is untenable that there will be no go areas in the country for law enforcement officers. The country’s democracy is predicated on the rule of law and if we are to achieve the vision championed by the National Development Plan all national laws must be adhered to. Furthermore, the seizure of counterfeit goods must be supported at all times as the illicit economy is negatively impacting the country’s Gross Domestic Product. Meanwhile, the committee has highlighted its displeasure at the lockdown of City of Tshwane by striking municipal workers over their disagreement with the municipality. While the committee welcomes the fact that the impasse has been resolved, the blocking of roads and preventing ease of movement is unacceptable. The committee will in its engagement with the management of SAPS highlight the need to strengthen training of police officers especially in relation to crowd management.
