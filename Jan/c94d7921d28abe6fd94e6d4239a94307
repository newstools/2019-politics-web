DA calls on MEC Lesufi to urgently conclude the placement of learners The Democratic Alliance (DA) is calling on Gauteng Education MEC, Panyaza Lesufi, to urgently conclude the placement of all learners who applied last year for school admission before the start of the 2019 academic year. The DA has been inundated with calls from parents who are still uncertain as to where their children will be placed. The department has failed to place all learners who applied for placement prior to October last year. This delay is causing uncertainty amongst parents who want to buy school uniforms and stationary before they go back to work, as well as budget for scholar transport. The much vaunted online application system should have helped the department to place learners and allocate resources. However, this has not been the case. The DA is calling for the department to take all possible measures to avoid last year’s crisis where the Human Rights Commission was asked to intervene as learners weren’t placed by end of February. This cannot be repeated; all learners must start with their lessons on day one of the 2019 academic year so as not to be disadvantaged going forward. The DA wishes all teachers and learners the best for 2019. All schools should be properly resourced and strive to be centres of academic excellence. Only the DA can build One South Africa for All, where the youth receive quality education at well-resourced schools.
