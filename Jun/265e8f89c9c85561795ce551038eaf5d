JMPD’s focused IOC Reaction Unit already leading to decrease in inner city crime 5 June 2019 The Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department’s (JMPD) IOC Reaction Unit has been tightening its grip on criminals operating in the Johannesburg Inner City with 45 arrests already made less than a month after launching. Since the launch of the Integrated Intelligence Operations Centre Reaction Unit (IOC Reaction Unit) on 14 May 2019, there has been a notable crime reduction in the Joburg inner city. The IOC Reaction Unit, which started with 80 officers, has since grown to 100 officers working undercover at the various parts of the Inner City, 24 hours a day. The synergy between the Integrated Intelligence Operations Centre (IIOC) where the city-owned CCTV cameras are monitored, and the strategic deployment and quick reaction time, muggers, armed robbers and hijackers are finding themselves in hand-cuffs and behind bars. Notable successes by the unit range from the arrest of three cable thieves caught red handed in Hillbrow, to muggers apprehended in Newtown. Another eight suspects were caught red handed in Fordsburg whilst loading stolen goods to the value of R 128 000. We have discovered that a large portion of these incidents are armed robberies, street muggings, pick-pocketing, hi-jacking, theft and drug dealing. By working with the private sector, we will continue to bolster this unit and expand the CCTV camera network to other parts of the City. JMPD, and especially the IOC and the IOC Reaction Unit, will continue to serve our residents and ensure their safety. I applaud these brave men and women who risk their own safety in order to protect our residents. I have no doubt that the synergy between the residents and government will keep criminals off our streets.
