Statement by Premier David Makhura on the adjust of the Executive Council 31 May 2019 On 29th May 2019, I publicly announced the appointment of Members of the Executive Council of the sixth administration in Gauteng province. During the swearing-in of new Members of the Executive Council on Thursday, 30 May 2019, I outlined the priorities of the six administration and gave the rationale for the allocation of portfolios to the Members of the Executive Council. There has been a lot of feedback received on the composition of the new Executive Council. This feedback has largely been profoundly positive. The team combines experience with youthful energy, talent, better education and fresh ideas. While there is an appreciation of the appointment of MEC Panyaza Lesufi to the Finance and e-Government portfolio, the overall non-partisan feedback from society, the education sector and the movement in general is that it will serve Gauteng better that he remains in the Education portfolio to continue the good work of ensuring that our province is the leader and pioneer of educational transformation. Yesterday, I indicated that I was giving serious consideration to the request and would announce my decision soon. The decision to appoint each MEC to a specific portfolio was not taken lightly. Accordingly, I have now decided that MEC Panyaza Lesufi will return to the Education portfolio as the MEC for Education and Youth Development. I have further decided that MEC Nomantu Nkomo-Ralehoko will be the MEC for Finance and e-Government. As I stated on Thursday, the team of ten MECs I have appointed have diverse set of skills, vast experience and talents that enable them to play different roles in several portfolios. Let the team get down to work to serve the people of Gauteng. Issued by Thabo Masebe on behalf of Gauteng Provincial Government, 31 May 2019
