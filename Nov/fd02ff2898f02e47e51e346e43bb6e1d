DA concerned about appointment of new Acting CEO for Gauteng Film Commission 6 November 2019 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) notes with concern the appointment of Shane Maja as the new Acting Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Gauteng Film Commission (GFC). Since 23 February 2017 when Mr Andile Mbeki the CEO was placed on suspension this entity has been run by acting CEOs. Shane Maja took over from Simangele Sekgobela who has been acting in the same position since 2017. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','1']));This clearly indicates that the appointment of a proper CEO seems to be a challenge for this entity. We cannot have an institution that operates with acting senior executives for years while a platform to have appointed full-time office bearers exists. The GFC has an important function to play in supporting the development of the film industry and it cannot be that it is left unstable for such a long time. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));This provincial entity needs a full-time captain to steer this ship and it can no longer rely on acting CEOs. I have tabled written questions to the Gauteng MEC for Sports, Arts, Culture and Recreation (SACR), Mbali Hlophe to ascertain why this entity has not yet appointed a CEO, why is this entity keeps appointing acting CEOs, and whether proper recruitment processes were followed in hiring Shane Majola and what the required qualifications are for the CEO position.
