Hlatshwayo was the ANC's mayor of Msunduzi from 2007 to 2010. In March 2010, the KwaZulu-Natal Executive Committee put the municipality under administration because of its financial status, non-compliance with various statutory obligations relating to finances, institutional and governance matters, and a lack of oversight by the council. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_5',115,'0','0']));Hlatshwayo and her executive were then removed. Soon after losing the mayoral chain, Hlatshwayo was appointed at the KwaZulu-Natal's health department. She was 33rd on the ANC's KwaZulu-Natal provincial to national list in the May 2019 elections, but didn't make it to Parliament. Opposition parties, with the DA being particularly vocal, opposed Hlatshwayo's appointment as PSC commissioner. The DA cheered and applauded when Frolick announced that there were not enough votes to appoint her. After dealing with the PSC commissioner, the National Assembly considered the nomination of advocate Kholeka Gcaleka for Deputy Public Protector. After a heated debate, Frolick postponed the vote to later in the day to ensure a quorum. News24eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-banner-1','ezslot_4',116,'0','0']));
