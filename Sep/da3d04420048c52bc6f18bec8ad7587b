Why are not all tenders going through the open tender system? 25 September 2019 It is concerning that the Gauteng Provincial Treasury only managed to process 96% of tenders through the open tender system. This is according to the GPT’s annual report for the 2018/2019 financial year. GPT implemented the open tender process system in all 14 departments and seven entities as part of strengthening supply chain management in the province. By not ensuring that all tenders go through the open tender process, it opens up the tender system to corruption. This is also hindering the development of township businesses. An effective supply chain management system is critical. This ensures that there is transparency and that all suppliers, particularly township suppliers are afforded the opportunity to provide goods and services to all government departments and entities in Gauteng. I will be tabling questions to the MEC for Finance, Nomuntu Nkomo-Ralehoko to ascertain what measures the department is putting in place to ensure that all tenders are processed through the open tender system and what the reasons are for only 96% of tenders been processed through the open tender system.
