MEC Maile’s failure to cooperate with SAHRC leaves a bitter taste 24 July 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) is disappointed to learn that the Gauteng MEC for Human Settlements and COGTA, Lebogang Maile, has failed to cooperate with the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) during an inquiry into Alexandra Renewal Project (ARP). It is alleged that MEC Maile refused to answer all the questions directed to him during an inquiry into ARP. It is unethical for MEC Maile to undermine a Chapter 9 Institution despite having taken an oath of office to abide by the Constitution. MEC Maile’s reaction clearly indicates that he cares little about the challenges faced by the Alexandra residents as a result of the failed ARP. The ARP was meant to improve the lives of Alexandra residents by building dignified housing and schools, developing roads, improving sanitation and service delivery. There is nothing to show for the R1.3 billion spent on ARP. Alexandra remains the worst overcrowded township with a high number of illegal structures and the mushrooming of illegal shacks. The residents are in desperate need of dignified housing. People of Alexandra have the right to know what happened to their money. SAHRC is the only hope for Alexandra residents to get answers on what happened to their money. SAHRC plays a critical role in this country in promoting and protecting the rights of every South African. Last month, l personally challenged MEC Maile to conduct an oversight where he hosts public representatives, the SAHCR and Alexandra residents on a walkabout of the areas where he alleges the money was spent. I gave the MEC 48 hours to rise to this challenge and add credibility to his words by conducting the oversight but he has not yet responded to my call. If MEC Maile has nothing to hide with regards to the role he played in ARP, why is he failing to cooperate with the SAHRC and to rise to my challenge?
