DA requests MEC Maile to investigate multi-million rand tender scandal in Lesedi Municipality 24 June 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) is calling on Gauteng MEC for COGTA and Human Settlements, Lebogang Maile to investigate the allegations of corruption involving a multi-million rand contract in Lesedi Municipality. It is alleged that Lesedi Municipality’s Acting Municipal Manager, Gugu Thimane flouted all supply chain management regulations and the Municipal Finance Management Act in order to manipulate a multi-million rand tender contract. It is alleged that Thimane awarded a R50 million security tender to Bravo Span 90cc security company without following the proper tender process. MEC Maile must investigate whether the awarding of this tender by Thimane was irregular and whether proper tender processes were followed. We call for the immediate suspension of Thimane while the investigation is pending. The DA will table questions in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature to ascertain the following: whether this security tender was advertised, if the proper tender process was followed and what role Thimane played in awarding this tender. Corruption and tender irregularities are criminal acts and have bankrupted most of our district municipalities Should it be found that due process was not followed in awarding this tender, then those implicated and who benefitted illegally must face the full might of the law.
