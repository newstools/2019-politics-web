ANC’s delaying tactics will cost the public, Zandile Gumede must be fired now 10 June 2019 The Democratic Alliance in eThekwini is disappointed with the outcome of the ANC’s Provincial Executive Committee Meeting this week, which merely resolved to request that Mayor Zandile Gumede take 30 days special leave. This decision comes 26 days after she was arrested on a slew of corruption-related charges and released on R50 000 bail. The ANC claim that they will use this time to decide her fate. This means that Gumede will sit at home for 30 days and earn her monthly salary of R112 000 (based on a yearly package of R1.35 million). All that will happen is that she will submit leave, continue to rake in taxpayers' money and leave Durban in the lurch. This decision is an obvious indicator that the ANC put their politics first, and the well-being of eThekwini Municipality a distant second. Gumede has been a hopeless Mayor and should be booted from office. This call by the DA has been supported by members of the public and fellow opposition parties. The sad part is that Gumede is still part of the regional task team, meaning the ANC still have faith in her . Our call is that It should not take the ANC 56 days to know that eThekwini residents deserve proper service delivery and committed leadership. The DA has also written to the Hawks regarding Gumede and fellow accused Mondli Mthembu’s bail conditions, which we believe they may be violating by their continued involvement in city governance. Gumede should not continue to earn a cent of ratepayers' money. Issued by Nicole Graham, DA EThekwini Caucus Leader, 10 June 2019
