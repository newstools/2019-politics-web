DA welcomes Bosasa’s voluntary liquidation application 18 February 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes Bosasa’s application for voluntary liquidation following various banks closing their accounts. Bosasa has been, for the past 20 years, at the heart of overseeing the capture of the ANC government. Although this liquidation is to be received with great celebration, it does not absolve the ANC government for their role in their seemingly corrupt relationship with Bosasa. This liquidation provides President Cyril Ramaphosa with a public opportunity to fire Mokonyane, Smith, Mantashe and all other implicated parties from the ANC-Bosasa benches. It is also of utmost importance that all remaining government contracts with Bosasa be audited or cancelled with immediate effect. The DA hopes that the announcement of this liquidation will be delivered in hand with a plan to recoup the billions stolen from taxpayers by the Bosasa scandal. South Africans deserve a government that will hold itself accountable for its mistakes, capture and corruption, and that will return every stolen or captured cent to its citizens. Furthermore, President Ramaphosa must also make public the terms and conditions of Andile Ramaphosa’s contract with Bosasa. Only the DA can build One South Africa for All, and will protect citizens from corrupt and captured government officials who prioritize their personal financial incentives above the lives of citizens. A DA government would institute a 15-year jail sentence for those found guilty of corruption, as those chosen to lead should never steal from those who have placed their trust in them.
