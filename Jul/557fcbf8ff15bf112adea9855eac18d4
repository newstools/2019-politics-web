ACDP calls on Parliament to conduct inquiry into EFF’s disgraceful conduct during Gordhan’s budget vote 12 July 2019 “The ACDP condemns in the strongest possible terms the disgraceful conduct by members of the EFF during the budget vote on Public Enterprises on Thursday afternoon. While parties may differ politically and engage in robust debate, the conduct displayed and the threatening attitude adopted towards Public Enterprises Minister, Mr Pravin Gordhan, is deeply concerning. What occurred presents a threat, not only to Mr Gordhan, but to Parliament as a whole, we as responsible leaders, cannot allow this 6th Parliament to be hijacked by bullying tactics in order to achieve a narrow, divisive political agenda. This, as our nation already has so many critical issues to which Parliament must attend, including state capture and corruption in State-owned companies and the impact this has had on our economy. It is disgraceful that the EFF members tried to prevent Mr Gordhan from addressing these issues.  Thankfully, they did not succeed. The ACDP calls on Parliament to conduct a full inquiry into the matter and to hold all those involved to account.” Issued by Steven Swart, MP, ACDP, 12 July 2019
