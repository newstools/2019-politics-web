Minister Masutha announces his decision on the Manuel Chang extradition 21 May 2019 Justice and Correctional Services Minister Advocate Michael Masutha has made his decision after considering the submission by the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development following the Kempton Park Magistrates Court  decision regarding the extraditibility of former Mozambican Minister of Finance, Mr Manuel Chang, to both the United States of America and the Republic of Mozambique. Minister Masutha considered the following: - That the accused is a citizen of the Republic of Mozambique - That the alleged offence was committed whilst he was minister of state in the Republic of Mozambique - The onerous debt for Mozambique as a result of the alleged fraud - The submission made by Mr Chang to be extradited to his home country - The interests of the States concerned - The seriousness of the alleged offence “I have noted that the request by the United States of America was submitted a few weeks prior to that of the Republic of Mozambique. However, having considered the matter in its full context, taking into account the criteria contained in both the US-SA Extradition Treaty, on the one hand, and the South African Development Community (SADC) Protocol on Extradition, on the other, as well as the relevant facts, I am satisfied that the interest of justice will be best served by acceding to the request by the Republic of Mozambique.  I have decided that the accused, Mr Manuel Chang, will be extradited to stand trial for his alleged offences in Mozambique,” said Minister Masutha.
