DA commits to continued service delivery in Joburg and Tshwane 29 November 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) would like to reassure residents that the current council matters in Johannesburg and Tshwane will not affect service delivery. In Johannesburg, the council meeting to elect a new mayor was adjourned to get a legal opinion on what the Municipal Structures Act means when it refers to a majority; while in Tshwane a motion of no confidence in the mayor has been disallowed. Despite these issues, the administrative processes have not been disrupted and remains stable in the two cities and we will work hard to re-establish political stability in both cities. In all we do, the residents and quality service delivery comes first. Issued by John Moodey, DA Gauteng Provincial Leader, 29 November 2019
