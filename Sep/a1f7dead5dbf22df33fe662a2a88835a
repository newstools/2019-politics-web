EFF STATEMENT ON THE PASSING OF PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE Friday, 6 September, 2019 The EFF sends its revolutionary and heartfelt condolences on the passing of President Robert Mugabe. May the family, close friends, ZANU-PF and the people of Zimbabwe be comforted. President Mugabe is one of the liberation fighters that ensured the independence and self-sufficiency of Zimbabwe and its people. He led this struggle with distinction and selflessness. On his passing, we remember against forgetting, that under his leadership, the Zimbabwean land reform program was suspended so as to allow South Africa to peacefully make the transition to democracy. As a people, we owe a lot of our own democratic freedoms to the leadership of President Mugabe. We join the world and the continent is saluting his formidability and bravery at the face of imperialists with their regime change agenda on Zimbabwe. Upon his government's land reform program, the UK and USA sought a military invasion of Zimbabwe. Together with President Mbeki, President Mugabe stood firm, refusing to give up the birthright of the Zimbabwean people to their land. This is his indisputable legacy that will yield fruit to the Zimbabweans for many years to come. May his soul rest in perfect and revolutionary peace.
