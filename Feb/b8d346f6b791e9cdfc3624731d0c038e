Support teams sent to stabilise struggling Free State municipalities following DA pressure 26 February 2019 The financially distressed municipalities of Mafube, Mangaung, Maluti-A-Phofung and Masilonyana will finally receive assistance from support teams meant to restore their stability because of the DA’s continued pressure. Cooperative Governance Minister, Zweli Mkhize, announced that a group of young graduates in the fields of engineering and construction management will be deployed to the province. While we welcome this intervention, it is however concerning that these municipalities have been tethering on the brink of collapse for years. It is seriously concerning that some of these municipalities have failed to pay their debts and their employees because of the rampant corruption and gross incompetence of the ANC government. For far too long, people residing in these municipalities have been deprived of basic services such as provision of water, electricity and refuse collection, among other things, due to financial rot and lack of infrastructure. This is the stark reality of the communities which continue to suffer at the hands of the failing ANC government which doesn’t care about the plight of the people. The DA will be closely monitoring this development to ensure that these teams achieve their objective of improving the infrastructure, ensuring speedier service delivery and turning around the financial standing of these municipalities. A DA government will stabilise the economy and build a capable state with fair access to opportunities for all. Issued by Patricia Kopane, DA Free State, 26 February 2019
