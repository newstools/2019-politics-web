DA calls for a full independent forensic audit of Eskom Given the dire state of power utility Eskom, the effect on the economy and the lives of ordinary citizens, the Democratic Alliance hereby calls for a full independent forensic audit of Eskom. The system of patronage, graft and political paybacks have prevailed, and urgent steps need to be taken to remedy the situation. This rot cannot be left unattended, as it has for decades, under successive ANC governments.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_6',112,'0','0'])); This follows remarks for Jan Oberholzer, Eskom’s COO in media interviews that “it doesn’t help to blame others for what happened in the past” and that “Eskom is captured ... [it] runs right through the entire organisation”. Additionally, it is not sufficient to re-establish an Energy War Room to be chaired by Deputy President David Mabuza, which will include Minister of Finance Tito Mboweni, Minister of Energy Gwede Mantashe and Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan – the same quartet that has delivered the utility and the country to this parlous place. What is needed is a thorough investigation into the maladministration and rot that has beset this key utility. Current measures announced by the Presidency, including the accelerated installation of André de Ruyter as Eskom’s new CEO, raises questions about the terms of reference of his appointment and whether this would involve buying him out of his current contract with Nampak.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_5',113,'0','0'])); The government on Friday asked industry for the cheapest and quickest options to ease a power crunch. What has been put forward, and what is to be implemented? Answers are needed – with urgency. Currently, twenty-year plus Evergreen contracts which will cost the country an estimated R1.4 trillion are in existence and the former Minister has refused to disclose the 27 IPP owners. This failure to disclose pertinent information creates more doubt and a heightened worry that those who participated in State Capture are still beneficiaries at the cost of the average South African and our economy as a whole! The country needs to know. We demand disclosure.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_7',114,'0','0'])); Statement issued by Ghaleb Cachalia MP - Shadow Minister of Public Enterprises, 17 December 2019
