X-ray leak at Kopanong Hospital 21 June 2019 I am extremely concerned by the report that all x-ray staff at the Kopanong Hospital In Vereeniging have been put on two months’ special leave as a result of a possible radiation leak. This is yet another example of poor maintenance at a Gauteng hospital that endangers staff and patients. According to the Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa (Denosa), the x-Ray Department at the hospital has been broken for some time. Other problems at this hospital include overcrowding at the casualty and a shortage of beds. We need to know what the true situation is at this hospital and what is being done to fix it. A key priority for new Health MEC Bandile Masuku is to come up with a proper plan to fix the endemic maintenance failures in Gauteng hospitals.
