A year later and still no justice for Esidimeni victims 19 March 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) notes that today marks one year since Justice Dikgang Moseneke made his ruling in the Life Esidimeni Arbitration case. It is of great concern that nobody has yet been criminally charged despite the clear evidence of wrong doing that emerged in the arbitration hearings. Furthermore, more than 300 Esidimeni victims are still waiting to be paid financial compensation by the Gauteng Provincial Government. Premier David Makhura presided over the Esidimeni Tragedy but has failed to make the amends which he promised. The Police have also been inexcusably slow in concluding their investigation into this matter. Like so much else, it highlights the ANC’s failure to hold to account those who have killed and stolen. There is still no justice for the Life Esidimeni victims. Issued by Jack Bloom, DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC, 19 March 2019
