Coligny murder: Men sentenced to 23 and 18 years in jail 6 March 2019 The two men convicted of killing Coligny teen Matlhomola Moshoeu will spend 18 and 23 years in prison. In imposing an 18-year sentence on Pieter Doorewaard and 23-year sentence on Phillip Schutte on Wednesday, North West High Court Judge Ronnie Hendricks saidÂ the murder was not planned and not premeditated. He said the court found the incident happened as a result of dolus eventualis. Doorewaard and Schutte were found guilty of murder, kidnapping, intimidation, theft, and pointing a firearm in November 2018. Sixteen-year-old Moshoeu died on April 20, 2017, after he was thrown from a moving vehicle. The men, however, claimed that he jumped from a vehicle while they were on their way to the police station with him after they caught him stealing sunflower heads at a farm. Moshoeu's death sparked protests in the area and several houses and businesses were burnt to the ground. Some residents claimed he was killed because he was black. Update: Murdered Coligny teen's father speaks after killers sentenced Sixteen-year-old Matlhomola Moshoeu's father, Saki Dingake, says he is "heartbroken" and "unhappy" about the sentences imposed on his son's killers. "I am heartbroken. I still can't accept that he is no longer with us (and) I am not satisfied with the sentences," an emotional Dingake told reporters shortly after the North West High Court adjourned on Wednesday. Dingake said he was expecting the accused to be sentenced to life in prison. News24  News24
