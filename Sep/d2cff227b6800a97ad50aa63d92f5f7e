SANEF notes with deep concern allegations against Ranjeni Munusamy 18 September 2019 The South African National Editors' Forum (SANEF) has noted the testimony of Colonel Kobus Roelofse at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, implicating Tiso Blackstar senior journalist Ranjeni Munusamy in accepting gratification from the Crime Intelligence unit. Roelofse testified that he uncovered a payment of R143 621.78 from a secret slush fund of the police's Crime Intelligence unit towards Munusamy's vehicle finance account in July 2008. At the time, Munusamy worked as a communications consultant for clients, including the Friends of Jacob Zuma trust. SANEF has noted Munusamy's denial of the allegation and welcomes her decision to cooperate with the Zondo Commission. SANEF champions ethical journalism and has launched its own Inquiry into Media Credibility and Ethics, chaired by retired judge Kathleen Satchwell. We encourage any South African with evidence of journalists acting unethically or illegally to approach Judge Satchwell and the authorities, including the Zondo Commission. Email panel@mediainquiry.co.za for submissions to the Inquiry. In terms of Munusamy, we welcome the decision by Tiso Blackstar to grant her special leave to deal with this serious allegation. We will closely follow Munusamy's cooperation with the Zondo Commission and will await the outcome of Tiso Blackstar's internal investigation.
