Tomorrow’s City of Joburg Council Meeting is illegal 10 December 2019 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0']));Whether or not one agrees with the ruling made by the Chair of Chairs, Alex Christians, last Thursday, 5 December 2019, regarding the motion brought against Johannesburg Speaker, Vasco da Gama - the ruling stands until overturned by a court. As such, Vasco da Gama is still the Speaker. Only the Speaker can call Council Meetings. The MEC cannot call a Council Meeting. Neither can the Mayor, or the City Manager. The Council Meeting called for 11 December 2019 is thus illegal, and any decisions taken at that meeting are null and void.
