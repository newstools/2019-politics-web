News of judicial inquiry into the Life Esedimeni tragedy after FF Plus request is welcomed 18 September 2019 The FF Plus welcomes the announcement by the National Prosecuting Authority that a judicial inquiry will be conducted into the Life Esidimeni tragedy that transpired in Gauteng and in which 144 people died. A judge of the High Court in Pretoria will lead the investigation. This follows after nobody was prosecuted after the initial investigation into the tragedy. Two weeks ago, during a session of the parliamentary portfolio committee for health, the FF Plus requested that the Life Esedimeni tragedy that transpired in Gauteng must be put back on the agenda of the committee. The FF Plus requested the committee chairperson to revisit the tragedy so as to prevent something like that happening again in the future. The FF Plus vowed in the past that the party will ensure that those who were responsible for the tragedy will be held accountable and get the punishment they deserve. The FF Plus is satisfied that justice will prevail. Issued by Philip van Staden, FF Plus MP and chief spokesperson: Health, 18 September 2019
