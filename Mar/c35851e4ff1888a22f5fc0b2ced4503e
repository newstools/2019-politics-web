EFF statement on successful rallies in Gauteng, Limpopo, Mpumalanga, Northern Cape and KZN 25 March 2019 The EFF expresses gratitude to the people of Sharpeville in Gauteng, Tubatse in Limpopo, eMalahleni in Mpumalanga, Kuruman in Northern Cape, and eThekwini in KwaZulu Natal, for successful EFF rallies over the long weekend. We thank you for the love, support, and confidence you have shown in the EFF. We want to thank our hardworking, revolutionary and fire eater CIC, Julius Malema, who addressed all these rallies with equal energy, determination, and passion. The CIC Julius Malema spoke to no less than 80 000 people at these rallies combined, in a single long weekend. We salute him, and call on our fighters to emulate him in his tenacity and hard work. We also extend gratitude to all ground forces and Commissars who have made these rallies possible. Let us double our efforts in mobilizing for total victory on 8 May, 2019. Fighters must know that Stratcom continues to wage war against us. They refuse to cover our events in an effort to hide the successes of the growth of EFF, so as to create an impression that we are small in numbers. Their pens continue to lie, misrepresent, and misinform society about who were are. The only way to defeat them is total commitment, day by day, on the ground. We must continue to speak to more people in a single day, than the whole media combined. Victory is certain, no retreat, no surrender.
