City warns that Stage 6 load-shedding could mean intermittent supply in some areas 10 December 2019 Load-shedding of this severity is likely to constrain our ability to provide water supply in the reticulation system across the whole of Cape Town in the usual way. Our pumps for both the water and sewerage systems cannot operate properly without power for significant periods. The nature or extent of the possible water supply interruptions is not yet known, but our operational teams are on full alert and the situation being monitored intensively. Updates will be provided on a regular basis. Residents should not panic, but please use water sparingly and prepare just in case they do experience a period of no water supply. The advice is to store enough municipal tap water for drinking, cooking and basic ablution. Use clean containers and keep them sealed for hygiene and safety purposes. All taps must be kept closed during this period to prevent any water loss and/or damage when the water supply is restored. The City apologises for any inconvenience that may be caused due to this operational challenge.
