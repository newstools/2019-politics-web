NC Premier off to a good start - OUTA 2 June 2019 The Northern Cape’s newly appointed premier, Zamani Saul, has prioritised education and health care over fancy cars and high salaries. Following an era of brazen state capture and corruption, the Premier’s sentiments are an attempt to restore faith in his constituency. “Reducing his cabinet is a positive first step, however, we will continue to keep a close eye on Premier Saul and ensure he fulfills all his promises,” says Julius Kleynhans, OUTA’s Operations Executive. “Saul touched on a critical component to do away with “public executives” and reinstate “public servants”. This is exactly what South Africans need and how provincial and local government should perform to restore faith in communities and good service delivery,” says Kleynhans. Saul has promised to cut back on wasteful expenditure in a province riddled with high unemployment and low economic growth. “We hope that other Premiers will make similar tough decisions and curb expenses that deprive citizens of their right to decent healthcare, education, safety and security,” added Kleynhans.
