Criminal chaos is thriving in Gauteng 12 September 2019 The annual crime statistics released by the South African Police Service (SAPS) today show an alarming increase of 262 murder cases from 4233 to 4495 in Gauteng. The statistics further show that: rape has increased by 355 cases from 8062 to 8417; assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm by 253 cases from 39 552 to 39805; robbery at residential premises are up by 311 cases from 8333 to 8644; common assault has gone up by 2003 cases from 43 587 to 45 590; common robbery has gone up by 773 cases from 16 984 to 17757; and robbery with aggravating circumstances has increased by 334 cases from 51706 to 52040. The rising crime rate in Gauteng is causing extreme stress among the residents, and nothing is being done about it. Across the province, people have no confidence in the police, whose job it is to protect them. Residents of Gauteng see the police as corrupt, incompetent and uncaring. People are becoming increasingly reluctant to report crime because of their lack of trust in the police. House burglaries and muggings are on the increase and people are scared to leave their homes. Twelve of Gauteng’s police stations have reported the highest murder rate in the country. Gauteng also ranks first in the murder of police officers killed on duty and second to KwaZulu Natal in those killed off duty. The poorest of the poor are not safe in the streets walking with their few belongings. In March, the DA met with Gauteng Police Commissioner, Lieutenant General Elias Mawela, to discuss his plans for policing in the province and get his commitment to increase the police force. But there has been no improvement. While criminal chaos is thriving in the country, the criminal justice system is in a state of collapse. It is unacceptable that crime is increasing while the police are under-resourced, poorly trained and under-staffed. The people of Gauteng cannot wait a moment longer. This goes much further than putting criminals behind bars. It requires the root causes of this social and moral decay to be addressed and bold leadership to make effective decisions. The DA's proposal is to transform the police force by tackling gender-based violence through dedicated programmes for victims, lobby for police competency in the province to more effectively address local needs, push for the return of specialised units, such as those that combat gang violence, hijacking, rural and organised crime and ensure the prosecution of corrupt police. If we are to win the fight against crime, we need an honest and professional police service that keeps people safe and maintains order. Only the DA can bring order to South Africa by bringing change that builds One South Africa for All. Issued by John Moodey, DA Gauteng Provincial Leader, 12 September 2019
