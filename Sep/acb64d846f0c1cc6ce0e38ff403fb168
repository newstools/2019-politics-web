GOOD welcomes and endorses Thuli Madonsela's social justice declaration 3 September 2019 Achieving social justice was one of the four pillars of GOOD’s election manifesto, and vision for a just South Africa, along with economic, environmental and spatial justice. GOOD therefore wholeheartedly agrees with the drafters of the Social Justice Declaration that South Africa needs a social compact on social justice, and that this can be achieved through government, business, civil society and the international community working together. On Thursday, Professor Madonsela, the Law Trust Chair in Social Justice at the University of Stellenbosch’s Faculty of Law, convened what the Inaugural Social Justice Summit. Delegates representing diverse constituencies committed themselves to a joint statement to work for accelerated social justice in post-apartheid South Africa. GOOD was represented at the conference by its National Policy Officer, Mark Rountree. “We noted with deep concern that the prevailing chronic levels of poverty and inequality created by colonialism and apartheid are being reinforced and exacerbated by the actions our governments are taking today” said Rountree “Societies that enable their citizens to reach their full potential are successful societies. South Africans impoverished by apartheid have had to wait too long for justice. Thuli Madonsela has played an important role in demonstrating what a rights based South Africa means, and her social justice initiative is just what the doctor ordered.” The Social Justice Declaration and the call for a social compact amongst all of society is what GOOD has been campaigning for. GOOD is committed to supporting it and to playing our part. #SocialJusticeSummit #SocialJusticeMplan Issued by Mark Rountree, GOOD National Policy Officer, 3 September 2019
