(Last week consumption was at 542 m/l per day). ‘We are thrilled to see the dam levels steadily increasing for the third week in a row. Additionally, with the drop in the daily consumption level, our dams are slowly but surely on the road to recovery. We remain optimistic that this is going to be the trend in the coming winter months,’ said the City’s Mayoral Committee  Member for Councillor Xanthea Limberg. According to the City’s records dams were just over 42% of storage capacity at the same time last year. ‘Dam levels are in a better position when compared to the same period in previous years, but we encourage residents to continue using water wisely. The City would like to thank the water warriors who continue to save this precious resource,’ added Councillor Limberg. Level 3 restrictions remain in place to aid dam recovery.
