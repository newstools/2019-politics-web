Desperate and violent ANC attacks DA Activists 15 March 2019 Today, during mobilization and campaigning activities in Soweto, Democratic Alliance (DA) Activists were attacked by members of the ANC, resulting in one of our members having to seek medical care. A case has been opened at the Naledi Police station and the matter will be reported to the IEC. This goes to show how desperate the ANC of David Makhura and Cyril Ramaphosa has become. The failing ANC has no answers for the people of Gauteng, therefore, their only retort is to violently attack the DA. The DA is gaining ground in Gauteng. The people of this province have seen the good work we have done in Tshwane, Johannesburg and Midvaal, and are calling for that kind of change in the whole of Gauteng. We stand ready to turn Gauteng into A Province That Works! The people of Gauteng deserve change that puts them first. Only the DA can bring real change that builds One South Africa for All.
