Cameron Dugmore to be leader of official opposition in legislature 20 May 2019 The ANC in the Western Cape has welcomed the appointment of Cameron Dugmore as Leader of the Official Opposition in the Western Cape Legislature. Comrade Dugmore’s nomination was unanimously supported at a meeting of the Provincial Executive Committee last Friday night. The nomination was forwarded to the NEC, which resolved to accept and endorse it at a special meeting held in Cape Town today. “We are confident that Comrade Cameron will be an effective and decisive leader of the Official Opposition in the Legislature. He is our most experienced Member of the Legislature and is a committed non-racialist who made his commitment clear by playing SACOS sport during the apartheid days. As a young white man facing conscription, he made public his refusal to serve in the apartheid army. Many are the stories of his loyalty and commitment to the ANC and the liberation struggle. “He has a wealth of experience as a past Member of the Opposition in the Legislature, and also as a former MEC. We believe that he will unite the Official Opposition and hold the DA to account. We wish him well,” said ANC Western Cape provincial secretary Faiez Jacobs.
