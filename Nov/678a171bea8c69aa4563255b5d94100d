Public Enterprises Chairperson urges SAA and unions to find solution to the strike 18 November 2019 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_6',112,'0','0']));The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises, Mr Khaya Magaxa, has noted with concern the utterances made by trade unions currently engaged in the South African Airways (SAA) strike. MrMagaxa said the recent reports in the public domain urging South Africans not to fly with SAA, following the national carrier’s announcement that international flights will be reinstated, are reckless and sabotage the national carrier. “Whilst the committee supports the rights of employees to strike within the confines of labour laws, it is irresponsible for the unions to make comments that the flights will be operated by short-term contracted personnel without the requisite experience.” MrMagaxa said the committee acknowledges the challenges facing SAA, which are a direct result of malfeasance and corruption caused by state capture. “Workers are not responsible for the situation at the national carrier,” said MrMagaxa. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_5',113,'0','0']));MrMagaxa urges SAA management and unions to negotiate to find a solution to resolve the strike, as it has serious ramifications for SAA’s financial situation and other unintended consequences in the economy and the tourism sector. “The committee would like to appeal to workers not to damage and destroy SAA’s credibility. If the employees continue down the path of destruction, this will lead to the destruction of jobs that we seek to protect and increase,” said MrMagaxa. “The SAA brand is important in ensuring improvement and profitability,” he added.
