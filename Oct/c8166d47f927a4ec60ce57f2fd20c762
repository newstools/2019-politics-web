SADTU demands immediate action on Eldoradopark Secondary School Situation 14 October 2019 SADTU Gauteng expresses disappointment in the conduct of the Eldorado Park Secondary School Governing Body and a group of community members. We had made a huge progress towards resolving the issue of the return of eighteen (18) teachers to their workstation. The union has been pursuing all available avenues to resolve the impasse. We had also resolved to suspend our protest action in favour of engagements. We held a very productive meeting on the 9thÂ of October 2019 which took several progressive decisions including the return of the teachers by today, 14 October 2019. Regrettably, the community led by the SGB and the DA resolved to block the teachers from returning to the school. We learnt with dismay that learners stormed out of their classes today demanding the return of their teachers. The situation has also become unbearable for the teachers who are at the school. This exposes the recklessness of the parents with the education of our children. We welcome the GDE's intervention on behalf of matric learners and equally call the GDE to take appropriate measures to save the future of grades 8-11 learners as a matter of extreme urgency. If this matter remains unresolved by 18 October 2019, the union shall revisit its position. Issued by Tseliso Ledimo, Provincial Secretary, SADTU, 14 October 2019
