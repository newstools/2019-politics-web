Clarifying the City’s position on the use of JMPD by private individuals 26 February 2019 Following the circulation of a video depicting JMPD officers providing escort services to a church leader, going by the name of Alpha Lakau, I had requested immediate update on the matter. This is after having previously discussed the matter with Chief of Police, David Tembe, when a similar video was circulated in November of 2017. At the time, it had emerged that the previous administration and the then JMPD leadership had allowed for a policy, whereby, members of the public could hire a JMPD escort at a cost. On discussion with the Chief Tembe, the practice was immediately subjected to review. Currently, provision is only  made for JMPD to provide traffic management services at funerals or specialised events. I am informed by the JMDP that the video in question is from the same incident in 2017. Our JMPD officers provide an invaluable service to all our residents – helping us ensure that our communities are safer spaces for all. They are a limited resources that cannot be made available for the exclusive use of one individual. Issued by Luyanda Mfeka, Director: Mayoral Communications, 26 February 2019
