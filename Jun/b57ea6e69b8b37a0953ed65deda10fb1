DA welcomes health intervention by Human Rights Commission 12 June 2019 The Democratic Alliance appreciates and welcomes the intervention by the SA Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) which visited the Mamelodi Hospital yesterday following the shocking abuse of 76-year-old Martha Marais who was tied to a bench there for more than eight hours. I am concerned by their finding of severe staff shortages and overcrowding which leads to poor service and low morale. The lack of a full-time CEO aggravates the problems at the hospital. I have also received many complaints of corruption at this hospital, including shoddy building work. The Gauteng Health Department has failed to spend its full capital budget for many years despite the huge backlogs for maintenance and expansion of facilities. Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku must be ruthless in rooting out corruption and he should ensure that competent personnel are put in key positions. There is no time for half-measures and retention of incompetent comrades, otherwise more tragic health incidents will continue to occur. The SAHRC’s recommendations should be implemented as soon as possible. Issued by Jack Bloom, DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC, 12 June 2019
