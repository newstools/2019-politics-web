DA calls on Premier Makhura to fire rude and unethical MEC Mazibuko 15 March 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) calls on the Gauteng Premier David Makhura to take decisive action against the rude and unethical Gauteng Sports, Arts, Culture and Recreational (SACR) MEC, Faith Mazibuko. The Premier has remained mum on the issue of corruption involving his long-serving MEC. Faith Mazibuko has shown herself to be someone who puts the party ahead of the people; she will use the people’s money to campaign for the failing ANC and is racially abusive. Faith Mazibuko is a bully, not servant of the people. It is not enough that the ANC has referred the matter to its Integrity Committee. This is not an ANC Party issue but rather a government issue, hence the Premier must take action against MEC Mazibuko. Premier Makhura is failing to tackle corruption in his administration and clearly lacks the boldness to act. For far too long, Premier Makhura had made empty promises that he is fighting corruption while he is failing to hold his own MEC to account. Gauteng residents have suffered enough corruption under the leadership of Makhura. He promised to conduct lifestyle audits for all politicians and senior officials in order to fight corruption and this has never happened. The DA demands that Premier Makhura fires MEC Mazibuko. What is clear is that a vote for the ANC is a vote for corruption. Issued by Solly Msimanga, DA Gauteng Premier Candidate, 15 March 2019
