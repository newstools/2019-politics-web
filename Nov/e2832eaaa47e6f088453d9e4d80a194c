3294 OPS CANCELLED AT BARA HOSPITAL 3294 operations were cancelled at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital from January 2018 to end-September this year. This has been revealed by Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku in a written reply to my questions in the Gauteng Legislature. The reasons for cancellation were as follows: Overbooking - 1262 Shortage of ICU beds - 926 Patient related - 559 Shortage of consumables - 210 Equipment related - 115 Infrastructure related - 312 Most of these factors are avoidable, caused by poor management that overbooks patients or fails to ensure working machinery and surgical supplies. The shortage of ICU beds for post-operative recovery is also of concern. The high number of cancellations is distressing for both patients and staff and worsens the long waiting times for surgery - more than 6000 patients currently wait more than six months for surgery at this hospital. According to Masuku, the following steps are being taken to reduce cancelled operations: Improving booking systems, indicating the operating time. Creating ward 7 High Care dependency for surgical department = 22 Performing some of the operations in cluster hospitals. Saturday elective list (Extra list). Extending arthroplasty list to 7 to 7 during the week. Strengthening of cluster systems and outreach. I hope that better management cuts the unacceptably high cancellation of operations at this major hospital. Statement by Jack Bloom MPL, DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC, 27 November 2019
