Hoërskool Driehoek: DA joins the nation in mourning the loss of four young lives 1 February 2019 The Democratic Alliance joins the people of Gauteng, South Africa and the Hoërskool Driehoek community in mourning the sudden and tragic loss of four young lives. We further convey our thoughts and prayers to at least 21 pupils who were injured in this incident, and commend the speedy response of EMS personnel. It is vital that all learners and teachers are afforded counselling. As a parent, the greatest fear is the idea of burying your children. This reality has befallen the families of the young lives lost in this incident. Together we mourn as a province and nation, and pledge our support to the parents and guardians. We call on the Gauteng Department of Education MEC, Panyaza Lesufi to investigate the cause of the accident and to ensure the safety of the learners and teachers in this school. I will be visiting the school on Monday, 4 February to personally express my sympathies and lend my support to the community during this time of grief.
