SACP responds to one Mr Julius Malema, the real constitutional delinquent as indeed exposed in the "On the Point of Tenders" report following an investigation by the former Public Protector Adv Thuli Madonsela 24 July 2019 As a matter of historical fact it is public knowledge that the SACP adopted a decision openly calling on former President Jacob Zuma to resign or be recalled if he did not resign, and finally to be removed from office through a motion of no confidence if he still did not resign after being recalled. To this end the SACP, with its First Deputy General Secretary Cde Solly Mapaila assigned to lead the implementation on a full-time basis, openly campaigned, calling on all South Africans from all walks of life to unite and rally behind the decision. The led by example by participating in supporting campaigns organised by other civil society formations. In this regard media archives are filled with indisputable evidence. Finally, the motion of no confidence that the ANC announced it was going to vote in fovour of if Zuma did not resign in February 2018 was not moved by the ANC but first by the EFF. The SACP fully supported the decisive ultimate move by the ANC, and does not regret doing so openly in line with our human and political rights as enshrined in our country's Constitution. This open public campaign was a principled programme, and the SACP strongly condemns any suggestion that it was either a conspiracy or a hidden conspiracy. The SACP strongly condemns any distortion or insinuation suggesting or seeking to suggest otherwise.
