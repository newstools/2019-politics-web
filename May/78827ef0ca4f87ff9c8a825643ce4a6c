Gauteng Health still in serious crisis 1 May 2019 Gauteng Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa has claimed that her department is on track to improve health care, but serious problems abound in hospitals and clinics. I am particularly disappointed that many vulnerable mental health patients are still poorly treated despite the lessons that should have been learned after the Life Esidimeni tragedy. According to the Public Servants Association of South Africa, mental health patients suffer inhuman conditions at the George Mukhari Academic Hospital in Garankuwa. The hospital treated 33 patients in a single ward equipped for 14 patients, with only one ablution facility at a time when the entire hospital was without water for a week. Financial compensation to more than 300 families of Esidimeni victims has still not been paid, and 15 Esidimeni patients are still missing. The department’s finances are still in poor shape, with a R5 billion deficit at the end of the financial year at 31 March because of huge accruals due to unpaid suppliers. It is clear that the failing ANC provincial government does not have the expertise and political will to fix the endemic mismanagement and corruption in our state hospitals and clinics. The comprehensive change that is needed can only be provided by a DA provincial government. Issued by Jack Bloom, DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC, 1 May 2019
