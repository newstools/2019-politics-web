A woman must be appointed speaker of Parliament - ANCWL 14 May 2019 The ANC Women's League (ANCWL) wants the next speaker of Parliament to be a woman and more women in President's Cyril Ramaphosa's Cabinet. The organisation would like to see some of its leaders, including its president Bathabile Dlamini, appointed in "strategic positions". "We want whatever positions we can get to be strategic so we can empower women. Of course, we wouldn't want our leader to be left out," ANCWL secretary general Meokgo Matuba said. On Monday, members of the ANC's national executive committee (NEC) appointed three new premiers to join four others in provinces it retained in the May national elections, leaving out the North West, a province which is expected to be resolved in coming weeks. The DA retained the Western Cape. Matuba expressed disappointment over Monday's deliberations, where the women lost their battle to have more than two female premiers in ANC-controlled provinces. "It always surprises me when you get women who are very comfortable with the current status quo," the league's general secretary told News24. Matuba said the league's role was to ensure more women were given a chance to lead. "We want a female speaker in Parliament. We have a male national leader, along with many female ministers," said Matuba. She added that while many recognised that gender parity was important some argued that the ANC was not ready or couldn't commit yet. "I am disappointed in some women in the ANC, some are even members of the ANCWL who claim to be for women but instead of moving out of their comfort space they give reasons such as stability and uniting the party," she said. Matuba also praised Ramaphosa and secretary general Ace Magashule for being progressive enough to understand the women's demand for more female representation, before expressing confidence in the president and the decision behind the appointment of his Cabinet.
