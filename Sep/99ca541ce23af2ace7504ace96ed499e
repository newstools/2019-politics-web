Khutsong Clinic abandoned while construction and security workers are not paid 19 September 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng is disappointed to learn that the Khutsong Clinic project in Extension 2 has stalled. Construction on the much-needed clinic was initiated in June 2015 at an estimated cost of R65 million. The DA discovered during a recent oversight visit that the clinic has still not been completed and has been abandoned by the contractor. See pictures here, here,   here and here. According to the Community Liaison Officer the contractor has not been paid by the Gauteng Department of Infrastructure Development (GDID). However, according to GDID the clinic has not been completed because the contractor is experiencing financial difficulties. As long as the management of the project flounders, the risk of deterioration of the asset continues to rise. This incomplete project is not only hindering the delivery of health care services to the community but has also left a number of construction workers without jobs and money as they were laid off without being paid. During my visit to the clinic I was told by the security guards that they still come to work, despite not being paid as they don’t want the property to be vandalised. It is clear that this department lacks the proper project management expertise, and this is leading to the taxpayer’s money not being spent efficiently. Furthermore, the Department of Health is oblivious to the dynamics of the projects for which it is paying. I will be tabling questions in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature to determine the exact reasons for the delay in this project and what steps are being taken to ensure that the construction of the clinic is completed as a matter of urgency.
