FF Plus welcomes Lesufi’s statement regarding unsafe schools in Gauteng 15 February 2019 The FF Plus welcomes the statement by Panyaza Lesufi, MEC for Education in Gauteng, that various schools in the province have safety problems and that there are approximately 190 schools in Gauteng that urgently need attention due to the poor condition of their infrastructure. Last night in Randburg during a meeting with principals and governing bodies regarding Gauteng schools’ failing infrastructure and poor maintenance, Lesufi said that "our schools are accidents waiting to happen" according to a media report (Netwerk24). Shortly after the Driekhoek tragedy in Vanderbijl Park, the FF Plus requested the Gauteng MEC and the Premier to urgently send structural engineers to all the schools in the province in order to prevent any more disasters. In the interim, parents closed down a school in Elandspoort, Pretoria West, because in their opinion, the structure poses a safety risk to children. The FF Plus has also received numerous complaints about schools' infrastructure from parents in Gauteng as well as the Free State. The FF Plus welcomes Lesufi's announcement that the treasury will make money available to repair schools and even to rebuild some of them. According to the MEC, they have already identified 37 schools that will be rebuilt. He also added that the Department will pay particular attention to schools that are more than 100 years old. The FF Plus is more than willing to cooperate with the MEC in this regard and will make all the information at the party's disposal available to him in the interest of the safety of all learners.
