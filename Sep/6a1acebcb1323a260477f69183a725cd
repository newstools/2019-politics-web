DA Youth outraged by the death of a female student at UKZN 9 September 2019 The DA Youth in KwaZulu Natal is outraged by the death of a student at the University of KwaZulu Natal (UKZN). Natasha Conabeer was reported missing on 8 August. Natasha was last seen on Florida Road in Durban a few weeks ago. Yesterday she was dropped off at her mother's house in Inanda, unconscious, where she was rushed to the hospital and got admitted to ICU. This morning she passed away.eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_3',112,'0', 0])); We are completely outraged by this incident as it comes at a time when the country is still reeling the death of Uyinene Mrwetyana, a University of Cape Town student and the brutal killing of 4 children in the Pinetown area. Additionally, yesterday’s media reports reported that two fathers have been arrested for allegedly raping their daughters in separate incidents in the Jozini area. The DA is disgusted by this barbaric and inhumane behaviour, we welcome the arrest and continue to plead with the law enforcement authorities to prioritise and speed up cases involving the killing and abuse of women and children. Many victims of rape and abuse have lost trust in the police and the government. We are calling on all youth formations including NGO’s and other stakeholders to join us in finding a lasting solution to the killing and abuse of women by men in our society.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0', 0])); We express our condolences to the family and friends of Natasha Conabeer. We are still calling upon men to stand up and end the scourge. We will be visiting Natasha’s family to offer our condolences and support during this trying time.
