SACP calls on eNCA to take strong stance against racism and decisive action against Kathan Pillay Statement, 19 December 2019 The South African Communist Party calls on eNCA to take a strong stance against racism. On Tuesday, 17 December 2019, Kathan Pillay reacted to politics journalist Samkele Maseko’s resignation from eNCA with the tweet: “Rats swimming toward a sinking ship… #EarlyXmasGift”. This racist reaction is an insult to Africans in particular. It is completely unacceptable and must have no place in our society. The SACP condemns it in the strongest terms possible. eNCA must apologise to South Africans, get to the bottom of the matter and get rid of Pillay.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0'])); The SACP will continue pushing media transformation and the struggle for a non-racial society.
