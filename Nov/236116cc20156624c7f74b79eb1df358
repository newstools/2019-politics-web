DA-led Midvaal Municipality an example to uphold 6 November 2019 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) applauds the announcement by the South African Local Government Association (SALGA) for ranking the DA-led Midvaal Local Municipality as the most stable municipality in Gauteng. SALGA also awarded Midvaal a clean audit award, for achieving an unqualified audit for the 2018/19 financial year. This is a win for the people of Midvaal and shows what hard work and dedication can achieve. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));It is further evidence of good governance. Working with the people of Midvaal, Mayor Bongani Baloyi has spent the full budget of R1.34 billion wisely and responsibly as it was meant to be spent. Midvaal is the only municipality to get a clean audit in Gauteng, and it means that its financials are reliable, compliant and on par with legislation and reporting performance standards. The DA-run Midvaal has a zero tolerance policy when it comes to misusing money. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));Where we govern as the DA, we will do our utmost to ensure that taxpayers’ money is spent on delivering services efficiently to our communities. The DA commends Mayor Baloyi and his team, and most of all, we commend the people of Midvaal for their support. Issued by John Moodey, DA Gauteng Provincial Leader, 6 November 2019
