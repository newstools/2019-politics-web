Agri SA welcomes Minister’s intention to work with organised agriculture 16 July 2019 Agri SA is heartened by the Minister of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development, Thoko Didiza's budget speech delivered at Parliament today. President of Agri SA, Dan Kriek, who attended the speech welcomed the focus on partnerships, agricultural finance, the commercialisation of black farmers and the productive use of land. “It is also positive that the Minister has recognised the importance of ethical conduct, the need to strengthen institutions, the problems with communal property associations and the need to have a bigger focus on bio-security” said Kriek. Agri SA is deeply involved in processes to develop a development financing model. Kriek called on the Minister to join forces with the private sector in this regard. “What the Minister did not deal with, however, is the question of policy uncertainty around property rights. The agricultural sector sorely needs policy certainty.” Kriek also reiterated Agri SA' s commitment to build an inclusive, thriving and globally competitive agricultural sector.
