DA Gauteng Cabinet Report Card: Gauteng ANC Government’s deterioration heaps misery on residents 10 December 2019 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));In May this year, through the power of the ballot box, the people of Gauteng made it resoundingly clear that they have had enough of the incompetence that has become the hallmark of ANC governance. The ANC managed to hold on to its majority by a single seat in the Gauteng Legislature. Despite this, the ANC has not self-corrected as many political pundits claimed they would. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));Instead, they continue to govern with the same contempt for the people of Gauteng as they have always done. Many of the issues that were synonymous with Premier David Makhura’s first five-year tenure at the helm of government have continued, and in some instances, have worsened. Emfuleni, Merafong, West Rand District and Lesedi remain ungovernable with little to no consequence for those who have robbed residents of their constitutional right to adequate service delivery. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));These municipalities’ financial standings have rapidly declined with many having to produce unfunded mandates. The VBS scandal that financially crippled Rand West and Merafong remain unresolved. Service providers are owed billions of Rands, including the state-owned entities of Rand Water and Eskom. The malaise that has plagued departmental entities, most notably the Gauteng Enterprise Propeller, continues unabated. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_6',115,'0','0']));The Executive continues to sit on forensic reports which would shed light on the corruption that has plagued this entity. The Democratic Alliance (DA) Cabinet report card is an analysis based on the individual MEC’s grasp of his/her portfolio demands, leadership skills, approachability, willingness to appear before oversight committees, and quality of written and oral responses to DA questions. Below is our assessment of the provincial cabinet. The full report card can be accessed here. Premier David Makhura: 4/10 MEC MbaliHlope: Department of Sports, Arts, Culture and Recreation: 4/10 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-banner-1','ezslot_5',116,'0','0']));MEC Tasneem Motara: Department of Infrastructure Development and Property Management: 3/10 MEC MorakaneMosupyoe: Economic Development, Agriculture, Environment and Rural Development: 3/10 MEC Panyaza Lesufi: Department of Education: 4/10 MEC Lebogang Maile: Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs and Human Settlements: 2/10 MEC Jacob Mamabolo: Department of Roads and Transport: 6/10 MEC Bandile Masuku: Personal score: 7/10 Department score: 2/10 MEC NomantuNkomo-Ralehoko:Department of Finance and e-Government: 3/10 The late MEC ThuliswaNkabinde-Khawe:Department of Social Development: Personal score: 7/10; Department score: 1/10 MEC Faith Mazibuko (aka Ms. Combi Courts): Department of Community Safety: 3/10 As highlighted above, the overall picture looks grim. As the electorally mandated official opposition in Gauteng, the DA strives to not only hold the executive to account on behalf of our voters, but on behalf of all of Gauteng’s residents. It is in this spirit that we work tirelessly to ensure that every person in Gauteng is afforded the humility as enshrined in our Constitution and to make this a prosperous province that provides every resident a chance at a better life. by Solly Msimanga MPL - DA Gauteng Caucus Leader
