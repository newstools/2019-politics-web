Time for Gauteng law enforcement authorities to act against ANC’s anarchy 11 April 2019 This morning the people of Gauteng woke up to incidents of anarchy in Orange Grove, Johannesburg and Hammankraal, Tshwane. These acts of criminal behaviour follow days of ANC-fuelled anarchy in Alexandra, and ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule’s thugs violently disrupting the Sandton launch of Pieter-Louis Myburg’s ‘Gangster State’. What is clear, and what the South African Police Service (SAPS) need to act on is that the ANC is actively coordinating and engaging in the burning of South Africa but in particular Gauteng. The ANC has no plan or vision for the people of Gauteng, and the DA’s growing support and programme of speeding up the delivery of quality services have the ANC resorting to acts of criminality in an attempt to hold onto power. We have reported the ANC’s role in the Alex anarchy to the SAPS and IEC but they can no longer drag their feet, as the ANC works to influence the outcome of the May 8 elections through a programme of anarchy, deliberate disinformation and destruction. I will today write to the Gauteng Provincial SAPS Commissioner, Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela, to immediately deploy a team to investigate and act against the ANC’s campaign to illegally collapse DA-run municipalities. First, it was Johannesburg, today it is Tshwane and tomorrow the ANC’s anarchists will work to burn Midvaal, one the best performing municipalities in the country. We also call on members not to misreport what is happening on the ground. These are not service delivery protests, these are criminal acts co-ordinated by the ANC, which is why we are calling on the SAPS to act. Indeed, more needs to be done to ensure that the municipalities we govern become places of pride but they are better places now that they were before the people placed their trust in the DA.
