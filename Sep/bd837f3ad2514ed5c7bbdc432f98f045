Police on decline in public violence and looting in Johannesburg and Tshwane 4 September 2019 As the arrest of people involved in violence has risen to 289 since the Sunday, police are experiencing a dramatic decline in public violence and looting in areas of Johannesburg and Tshwane. However, police management is concerned about a campaign of fake news on social media highlighting a spectrum of violence that incites and instils fear among the residents of Gauteng. Last night in Ekurhuleni a total of 100 people were arrested when police responded to several incidents of public violence and looting. Fifty-four (54) of these suspects were surrounded by the police in Tokoza and Katlehong whilst they were inside two businesses stealing furniture and groceries. Others were arrested for public violence in Buhle Park, Germiston and Elsburg for public violence. Today’s false information on fake social media relating to the schools that are burning and the kidnapping of school children in Katlehong is geared to incite violence and instil fear among the Gauteng communities. The abuse of social media has since the flare-up of the recent incidents of violence and looting of businesses in some parts of Gauteng, is being condemned in the strongest terms as it seeks to undermine the authority of the state. The Provincial Commissioner of Gauteng has increased reinforcements to deal with any situation since the violence has stabilised.
