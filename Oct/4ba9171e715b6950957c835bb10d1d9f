The EFF welcomes the judgment by the Constitutional Court on the Intimidation Act 23 October 2019 The EFF welcomes the judgement by the Constitutional Court having the Intimidation Act of 1982 struck down as unconstitutional. Acting Justice Aubrey Ledwaba correctly observed that the broadness of the act could even lead one to be jailed for calling for expropriation of land without compensation. In effect, this apartheid era legislation criminalises free speech and freedom of expression which contradicts the constitution. The section of the Intimidation Act that was struck down as unconstitutional is also a law that was used to charge Fees Must Fall activists. The use of such legislation is reminiscent of the repressive regime that characterised the apartheid era. Hence, for the post-1994 democratic dispensation to make use Of this legislation is clear demonstration of how the government has adopted techniques Of the past to vilify people who fight for the complete emancipation Of the black masses. Right wingers will tirelessly work against us achieving economic freedom in our lifetime by maintaining repressive legislation such as the Intimidation Act and the Riotous Assemblies Act in order to undermine the struggle. However, nothing can stop the tide from turning. As the EFF, we applaud Commissar Primrose Sonti and community activist General Moyo who unflinching fought for this act to be struck down.
