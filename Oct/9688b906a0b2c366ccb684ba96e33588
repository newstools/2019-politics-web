Life sentence for Dros Rapist a good step in the fight against abuse of women and children 17 October 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) has noted the Court ruling today sentencing the Dros rapist, Nicholas Ninow, to life in prison. The DA has always held the view that Ninow deserved the maximum possible punishment for raping a minor. In addition to the life sentence, Ninow has also been sentenced to 5 years for the possession of illegal substances as well as 5 years for defeating the ends of justice. South African women and children are under siege by predators of vile acts of sexual assault and Gender Based Violence. They often suffer in silence at the hands of a callous government. The DA trusts that Ninow’s sentence sends a strong message to those who commit acts of violence against women and children. While this life sentence will not take away the memory of the suffering she had to endure, we hope that it will at least bring some level of justice and closure for the family and the survivor. The DA will continue to fight for the rights and safety of women and children in our country Issued by Refiloe Nt’sekhe, DA National Spokesperson, 17 October 2019
