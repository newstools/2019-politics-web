DA-led multi-party coalition will continue delivering services for the people of Tshwane The Democratic Alliance (DA) and its coalition partners will continue to deliver efficient basic services to the residents of Tshwane and ensure that other services rendered to residents are not affected. The DA has noted the motion of no confidence brought by the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in DA-led City of Tshwane Mayor, Stevens Mokgalapa, despite the great progress the DA-led administration has made since taking over the City of Tshwane administration in 2016. A decision by the EFF to vote against the DA will hand the City back to ANC corruption and mismanagement. This is an opportunity for the EFF to show their interest in the well-being of the citizens of Tshwane. The DA-led multiparty administration should be given the space to continue the good work it has done in line with its vision of building One Tshwane for All through open and fair access to jobs, speeding up the delivery of quality services and eliminating corruption. The EFF should not allow Tshwane to be subjected to the same chaos being experienced in the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality. Since taking office in 2016: Moody’s has assigned a stable outlook to the city for improving its operating performance, declining debt and rising liquidity; Extended access to better healthcare by taking mobile clinics to taxi ranks; Increased investments in the Tshwane Automotive Hub which are aimed at creating 20 000 permanent and temporary automotive jobs for residents; Started working on the construction of a R12 million taxi rank in Centurion; Started investigations into the corrupt purchase of the Strydfontein, Klipfontein and Roodepoort farms while the ANC was administrating the municipality; Recruited more than 400 jobseekers during phase 4 of the city’s EPWP recruitment process which aims to create a further 110 000 jobs for residents; Extended clinic hours at 24 facilities; Set aside R32 million to deal with illegal land invasions in 2019/2020; Written off a total of 2,6 billion off the city’s indigent accounts to provide relief to poor residents; Corrected an inherited R2 billion deficit and shown a surplus at the end of the first financial year in office in 2017; Uncovered an amount of over R1.5 billion that was squandered by the previous ANC administration; Reduced unauthorised expenditure by over a billion and irregular expenditure by R100 million; Awarded 1800 bursaries to the value of R34 million; Reduced unauthorised expenditure by over a billion rand; Slashed the 900-plus political appointees in the Mayor’s Office; and Sold the mayoral mansion to build 52 RDP houses These achievements clearly show that the DA and its coalition partners are committed to bringing change to the lives of the residents of Tshwane.
