DA in Gauteng launches new tip-off line to curb corruption in the licensing department 18 November 2019 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_5',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng has launched a tip-off line, where people can anonymously report any incidents of bribery from the Department of Roads and Transport. The DA is calling on anyone in Gauteng who has been asked for a bribe for a driver’s licence, driver’s licence renewal or roadworthiness certificate to share their stories on the tip-off line. This new tip-off line will help to fight bribery and corruption where it exists in the department. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_4',113,'0','0']));There have been numerous allegations of corruption within the department of roads and transport. Corruption in this department is serious as it means that those who pay bribes to officials are a danger on our roads if the proper process of obtaining a driver’s licence and roadworthiness certificate is not followed. This new tip off line forms part of the DA’s commitment to fight corruption within government departments. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_6',114,'0','0']));The only way to root out corruption is if residents name and shame officials implicated in corruption. The DA is urging anyone with information to send an e-mail to tipoffGP@da.org.za., with the date, time, place, description of what happened and the name of the official involved.
