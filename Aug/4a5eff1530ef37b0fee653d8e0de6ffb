DA commends City of Joburg financial stability 6 August 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) commends the financial stability of the City of Johannesburg, the healthiest financial position the municipality has ever been in, under the leadership of Mayor Herman Mashaba. False allegations by the ANC about Joburg finances are misrepresenting the true financial state of the City. Mayor Mashaba and his team have been working hard to stabilize the metro after years of poor governance, financial ruin and corruption by the previous ANC administration. When the DA took over the city, we inherited an unconscionable service delivery backlog, and uncovered corruption worth billions. We have also ensured that municipal supply chain processes, which were never followed by the ANC administration, are now enforced. It is shocking that the ANC wants to table a motion of no confidence in Mayor Mashaba, claiming that the city is on the brink of collapse. This move by the ANC would take the residents of Joburg back to the days of corruption and all-out theft. This tactic of a motion of no confidence has been used by the ANC in Johannesburg before, in 2016 and 2017. We salute the multi-party government led by the DA, for ensuring that the City has spent 91% in Capital expenditure, has a debt redemption fund valued at R2.5 billion, spent 100% of its Urban Settlements Development Grant (USDG) funding, has long term assets to sufficiently cover long term liabilities and only debt that remains in line with the National Treasury’s norm. The DA is working hard to bring change to all people where we govern, and in the City of Johannesburg this is made possible through turning the finances of the City around. Well done to Mayor Mashaba and his team. Issued by John Moodey, Gauteng Provincial Leader, 6 August 2019
