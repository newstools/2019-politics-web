The South African Human Rights Commission appalled by social media comments about Hoërskool Driehoek Tragedy 5 February 2019 The South African Human Rights Commission is appalled by comments on social media apparently made by Black First Land First (BLF) Secretary and Spokesperson, Mr Lindsay Maasdorp and others in the wake of the Hoërskool Driehoek tragedy.  The comments are insensitive, offensive, and inappropriate and do not align with the ideals and aspirations of our constitutional democracy. Kindness, compassion, and respect are basic human values which we should be extending to each other in a time of loss.  Death does not discriminate.  Grief cuts across race, class, gender, sexual orientation, religion, nation, and culture. Dignity is a constitutional value to which we are all enjoined by our Constitution to respect. While the Commission recognises that free speech is a constitutionally protected right, this right should be exercised in a way that does not infringe on the right to human dignity or on any other rights protected by the Constitution.  The right to free speech should be exercised responsibly.  The death of children – irrespective of race, social class, colour, culture, or custom – is a tragedy. The Commission reiterates its condolences to the grieving parents, families, class-mates, educators, and friends of those who lost their lives. As of mid-day 5 February 2019 the SAHRC has received approximately 80 complaints related to comments made on social media regarding the Driehoek tragedy.  The Commission will be approaching the Equality Court for relief on utterances allegedly made by Mr Maasdorp and will be assessing the merits of each of the other complaints received before deciding on a course of action.
