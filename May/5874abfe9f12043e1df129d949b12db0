New SASSA CEO’s 3 priorities to protect the needs of vulnerable grants recipients 21 May 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) notes the appointment of Busisiwe Memela-Khambula as the new CEO of South African Social Security Agency (SASSA). While Ms Memela-Khambula may come with experience, she has a tough task ahead of her in fixing the myriad of challenges facing SASSA. There are three key areas she needs to focus on as a matter of urgency: - Security at all pay points to ensure that social grant recipients are protected from muggings and other criminal elements; - Probing and ending illegal third-party deductions; and - Ensuring that the biometrics enrolment system is completed and that staff are properly trained to be able to use the system to ensure that fraudulent claims are reduced. What the entity requires now more than ever, is a strong leader who is dedicated to turning things around and putting the interest of the millions of South Africans who depend on them, first. It cannot be that vulnerable social grant recipients are constantly on the receiving end of SASSA’s failures. As the nation anticipates President Cyril Ramaphosa’s new Cabinet, we call on him to appoint a Minister of Social Development who is the exact opposite of Minister Bathabile Dlamini. Vulnerable South Africans deserve a Minister who, instead of lining their pockets, will prioritise the needs of the poor and marginalised. A compromised and unethical leader cannot be at the political helm of one the country’s most important agencies. While the DA wishes Ms Memela-Khambula well in her new role, we will keep a very close eye on her performance and remind her that she serves the interest of the people, not the politically connected few.
