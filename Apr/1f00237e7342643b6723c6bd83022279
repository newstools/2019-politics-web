DA to refer Mayor Mashaba’s latest Alexandra revelations to the IEC 17 April 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) will supplement the existing Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) complaint against the ANC for the Alex violence with City of Johannesburg Mayor, Herman Mashaba’s recent revelations on this matter. It has emerged that the ring-leaders of the Alex shutdown are directors of the Ditlodi Community Development Cooperative which was contracted to do community liaison work for the Alexandra Renewal Project. Coincidentally, following the cancellation of their contract by the Johannesburg Development Agency in February 2019 the very same directors of Ditlodi Community Development Cooperative are now behind the violent protests in Alexandra. What is clear is that these protests were born from the self-interests of a politically connected few and were not in the interest of the legitimate concerns of the people of Alexandra. Given their connection to the ANC, we are left to wonder if they were not instructed by the ANC. These revelations today require an urgent and immediate probe by the IEC. The Commission can no longer remain mum on the ANC’s hand in the violence and disorder which erupted in Alexandra. It is only a morally bankrupt organisation, such as the ANC, that would hijack the genuine concerns of the poor, who they have neglected for more than 25 years, for their dwindling political prospects. Unlike the previous corrupt ANC -administration, the current DA-led administration has prioritised the delivery of services to the people of Alex. While the ANC looted billions from the Alexandra Renewal Project, the DA is bringing change to Alexandra and other poor communities. The DA is committed to building One South Africa for All, and our objective remains uplifting and empowering the people of Alexandra and other poor communities.
