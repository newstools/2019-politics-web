Ramaphosa should not use presidential pardon to buy votes 18 April 2019 Reports that President Cyril Ramaphosa is considering pardoning AbaThembu king, Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo, must be seen for what it is – an attempt to buy votes in light of the ANC’s dwindling prospects at the polls. The granting of a presidential pardon is a very sensitive matter and must be applied on a rational basis.  The DA will keep a close eye on this matter. That the President is considering releasing a man convicted of assault, arson, kidnapping and defeating the ends of justice at this moment in time smacks of politicking and an abuse of the presidential prerogative for narrow political gain. Furthermore, any reduction in King Dalindyebo’s sentence should be considered by a court of law and not granted by the President or the Minister of Justice. The Executive has no power to grant a reduction in a sentence. To do so would be a serious breach of the separation of powers as set out in the Constitution and cannot stand. Should President Ramaphosa pardon King Dalindyebo (or attempt to reduce his sentence), it would be yet another indication that not much has changed since Zuma left.
