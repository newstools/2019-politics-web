ANC continues to sabotage service delivery in Joburg 20 September 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) condemns the ongoing disruption of Council meetings by the ANC in the DA-led multiparty City of Joburg. This is a clear intent to sabotage the delivery of services to the residents of Johannesburg and to stop Council from meeting certain legislated deadlines. This morning, proceedings were brought to a halt yet again, following several disruptions by unruly ANC Councillors yesterday. The ANC Councillors want Council Speaker Vasco da Gama to place another Motion of No Confidence against Mayor Herman Mashaba on the agenda. Three other attempts have failed, one of which they withdrew. It is shocking that the ANC wants to table another motion of no confidence in Mayor Mashaba when it is them that failed the residents of the city for more than two decades, depriving them of services. These disruptions are aimed at stopping service delivery, at the expense of the people of Joburg. Since taking over the City of Johannesburg, Mayor Mashaba has improved the city’s finances and worked hard to remove the corrupt system the ANC left in the City of Johannesburg. The ANC must allow Council proceedings to go ahead, to allow the DA-led City of Johannesburg to continue delivering services to the residents.
