DA welcomes the deregistering of the BLF as a political party 5 November 2019 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes the deregistration of the Black Land First (BLF) movement as a political party. Since its inception the BLF has caused division amongst South Africans as its constitution stated that only black people can be members of their party. The deregistration of the party comes after it was found that they had contravened Section 16(1) (c) of the Electoral Commission Act which states that the IEC may not register a political party which indicates that persons will not be admitted to membership of the party or welcomed as supporters of the party on the grounds of their race, ethnic origin or colour. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));Furthermore, the Electoral Act is clear that incitement to violence and stoking of racial hatred is prohibited. There is no place in this country for such parties or politicians who gain votes by stoking vicious hatred. The DA believes that the role of a political party is to foster unity and embrace the diverse cultures that are to be found in South Africa. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));South Africa needs public representatives who understand that we are better together.
