Molefe says he’ll pay back the money 18 August 2019 Former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe’s attorneys today said in a letter to Solidarity that they request a 30-day postponement for the payment of the R700 000 that Molefe owes Solidarity.This comes after Solidarity instructed the sheriff to proceed with the attachment of Molefe’s property. Solidarity Chief Executive Dr Dirk Hermann said that a period of 30 days was an unnecessary long time for the repayment of the money, and Solidarity communicated in a letter to Molefe that he has only seven days to repay the money. Meanwhile, the Eskom Pension Fund also told Solidarity that they gave Molefe until 22 August to repay the approximately R10 million owed to the fund. The fund also told Solidarity that if they do not receive the money, they will take vigorous legal action to recover the money from Molefe. “For Solidarity, it is solely about accountability. Money cannot be plundered by tax plunderers and then they walk away scot-free. We trust that the pressure we exerted on Mr Molefe will be a warning to other tax plunderers. They will be held accountable for their unlawful actions, and they will not be able to hide behind court processes any longer,” Hermann said. Solidarity also wrote to the National Prosecuting Authority to compel them to go ahead with the prosecution of Brian Molefe. Should they fail to do so, Solidarity will employ Adv. Gerrie Nel of AfriForum’s private prosecution unit to bring tax plunderers such as Molefe to book. Issued by Deon Reyneke, Solidarity’s Deputy General Secretary of the Energy Industry, 18 August 2019
