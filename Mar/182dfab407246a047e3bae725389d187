Ennerdale Secondary School on the brink of collapse 7 March 2019 Some parents are electing to keep their children at home rather than risk potential injury due to dilapidated infrastructure at Ennerdale Secondary School. Schools should be places of safety, and provide an environment which is conducive to teaching and learning. Ennerdale Secondary School is currently facing the challenge of having 21 unusable classrooms, and two blocks that are inaccessible due to unstable bridges. This is unacceptable. The constant neglect of schools in Gauteng by the failing  ANC-led Provincial government has left us with an enormous structural backlog. The ANC-led Gauteng lacks the capacity and a clear, concise plan of how they will deal with the infrastructure backlogs at our schools. An urgent audit of school infrastructure within the province needs to be conducted so that we get a complete picture of what needs to be done. This will assist us in comprehending the scale of the backlog, and also ensure that all learners are in well-equipped classrooms that includes safe access to decent toilets. We cannot afford another tragedy  like the one Hoerskool Driehoek in Vanderbijlpark, where young lives were lost. The DA is the only Party that can clean up the mess left by the ANC government. We will continue fighting to ensure that big budgets are well spent rather than lining the pockets of a few politically connected individuals.
