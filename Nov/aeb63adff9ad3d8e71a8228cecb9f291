This was revealed to me by the Gauteng Department of Sports, Arts, Culture and Recreation (SACR) MEC, MbaliHlophe in a written reply to my questions tabled in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature. The figures are as follows: eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_5',113,'0','0']));  This clearly indicates a serious lack of financial and consequence management by the department. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_7',114,'0','0']));These irregular appointments, tenders and Performance Management Development System (PMDS) payments has been ongoing for years however this was only revealed after the DA asked questions. According to MEC Hlophe, these irregular appointments, tenders and PMDS payments were investigated. The investigations confirmed the irregularities and non-compliance with the supply chain management system. Four officials have been charged with misconduct for irregular appointments and PMDS payments. The other three officials have also been charged with misconduct for contravening the procurement process. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_8',115,'0','0']));Only one official was dismissed in February 2019 for gross misconduct and dereliction pertaining to an irregular appointment and irregular payment of a SMS performance reward. Despite that the investigation confirming that several officials are implicated none of them have been suspended. The DA calls on the MEC to act against the seven officials implicated in these irregular appointments, tenders and PMDS payments. Financial mismanagement without consequences has become the norm within the Gauteng Provincial Government and the department must act against the accounting officer.
