EFF welcomes sentencing of Dros rapist to life sentence 17 October 2019 The EFF welcomes the sentencing of the DROS Rapist, Nicholas Ninow to life imprisonment. This is not only a triumph of justice, but a definitive vindication of the victim and her family. Our justice system must never show any form of remorse to heartless, cold rapists and murderers of women and children. The case is part of the examples of a speedy resolution of rape cases that must inspire all of us to report and see to it that rapists are removed from our society. The EFF calls on the SAPS and NPA to exercise the same efficiency in all outstanding rape cases that are gathering dust in many of our police stations. Nothing can defeat the scourge of rape and murder of women and children than the biting claws of justice. We express our sincere solidarity with the family and victim, hoping that this will help them get closer to some resolution. It will take a very long time for a child to overcome such horror and trauma; however, the knowledge that justice was done, and the perpetrator was removed from society for good, gives her a chance to grow up and find her path to healing without this rapist in our midst. We all know that there are many more Nicholas Ninow's out there, sharing spaces with women and children inside our homes, churches, restaurants, schools and malls. All of them must know that justice is coming soon and they will end up where Nicholas Ninow is; spending all their lives in the dungeons of imprisonment without any hope of return to the open society.
