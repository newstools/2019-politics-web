Absa Did Not Donate to CR17 Campaign 11 August 2019 Absa has noted with concern the report in today's Sunday Independent where “Absa Nation Building” is listed as a donor to the CR17 political campaign. As a policy, Absa does not make donations to political parties or politicians.  Consequently, Absa did not make a donation to President Cyril Ramaphosa's ANC presidential campaign in 2017 or any other campaign of that nature. Today we contacted Mzilikazi wa Afrika, one of the authors of the article who confirmed to us that “Absa Nation Building” was a transaction reference by third parties, not an entity. Thus, the link to Absa is purely coincidental. That name does not exist as an entity within Absa. Issued by Phumza Macanda on behalf of Absa, 11 August 2019
