SEAPU condemns the attacks of paramedics in Khayelitsha 26 March 2019 The South African Emergency Personnel’s Union (SAEPU) condemns the attacks of two EMS workers in Khayelitsha, Cape Town. Over the weekend two crew members were robbed at gunpoint in Khayelitsha. The crew were responding to a call in Harare on Saturday when they got attacked by Four unknown armed men. The men opened fire and robbed the crew all their belongings including ambulance radios. We would like to condemn this unfortunate incident in all possible terms. We are very worried because our Paramedics continue to get attacked and Department of Health is not willing to help in making sure that these attacks stop, our workers get security/ police escort when attending calls especially during the night. As we continue with our #STOPATTACKINGOURPARAMEDIC campaign, we would also like to call on all our Personnel to never forget to arm themselves when attending calls.
