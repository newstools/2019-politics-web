Another farm attack highlights need for rural safety units Another farm attack in the Free State on Saturday, highlights the Democratic Alliance’s urgent call for rural safety units, so as to keep both farmers and farmworkers safe. Janus Powell was gunned down over the Easter Weekend in the Hoopstad/Bloemhof district. This comes only days after the DA protested in Bloemfontein, calling again for rural safety units. The DA during its march on Wednesday last week handed over a memorandum to the Free State police commissioner, Lt. Gen. Afonso. With every day that Afonso delays acting on this call, more lives are being lost. We need real change that will value the lives of all South Africans and who will act immediately to stop all murders. Under a DA provincial government a rural safety unit for the Free State will be established without further delay. We send our heartfelt condolences to Janus Powell’s wife, Anemi, their 4 year old son and his parents, Antoon and Tharina.
