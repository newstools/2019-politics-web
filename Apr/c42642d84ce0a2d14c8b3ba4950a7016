DA calls for prosecution of Jiba and Mrwebi following Mokgoro Inquiry findings 25 April 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) notes reports on the outcome of the inquiry conducted by retired Justice Yvonne Mokgoro, finding Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi unfit for office. If reports are accurate, it is indeed a great day for the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) and the criminal justice system as a whole. A finding that Jiba and Mwrebi effectively sold out to the highest bidder and in the process played a massive role in the state capture mechanism which allowed the scale of corruption we have witnessed to proceed with almost guaranteed impunity. The Mokgoro Inquiry findings vindicates all those individuals who testified before it and demonstrates the levels to which they stooped to accommodate their political masters. The almost total decimation of the entire criminal justice system was the result of these and other officials ignoring their constitutional duties and aligning themselves with whoever made the highest bid. If the reports are correct, then President Cyril Ramaphosa can do nothing else but fire them both, and the NPA should give serious consideration to prosecuting them both.
