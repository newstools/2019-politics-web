All Candidates are eligible to run for DA Federal Council Chairperson 7 October 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) has taken note of incorrect reports, which state that the Party is seeking a legal opinion on the eligibility of one of the candidates standing for the position of Federal Council Chairperson. We wish to dismiss this notion. As the Presiding Officer, I am satisfied that all those who have been nominated have been fully vetted and meet the criteria to stand as candidate of Chairperson of Federal Council. In this light, we wish to remind all the candidates and their campaign teams of the rules of engagement, which preclude candidates from negative campaigning. We trust that all the candidates, namely Athol Trollip, Thomas Walters, Mike Waters and Helen Zille, will campaign on their own credentials and their offer of building a party that espouses the values of Freedom, Fairness, Opportunity and Diversity, with a vision of Building One South Africa for All. Issued byÂ Desiree Van Der Walt, Presiding Officer of Federal Council Elections, 7 October 2019
