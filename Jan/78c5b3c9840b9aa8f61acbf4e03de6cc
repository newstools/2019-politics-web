NEHAWU welcomes PIC investigation into allegations of impropriety by board members 31 January 2019 The National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union [NEHAWU] welcomes the decision by the board of the Public Investment Corporation [PIC] to investigate allegations of impropriety against its acting chief executive officer and two non-executive directors. The national union further welcomes the commitment by the Deputy Minister of Finance and Chairperson of the PIC, Honourable Mondli Gungubele, to subject himself to the pending investigation. NEHAWU views the allegations made against the Deputy Minister in a very serious light and it is very important for him to clear his name and prove that he is not involved in any forms impropriety at the PIC. As NEHAWU, we hope that a thorough investigation free from interference will be undertaken to unearth any wrongdoing that has led to the PIC losing workers’ hard earned pension funds. The national union holds a strong view that there is more skeletons still hidden in the closet and that they must be let out in order to ascertain the extent of the rot at the state asset manager. NEHAWU will continue to demand answers from both the PIC Board and the Deputy Minister about the Ayo Technology Solutions investment and how they plan to recoup the R4.3 billion lost in the deal. Those responsible for the deal must be immediately unmasked and they must face the full might of the law. We will closely monitor this matter to ensure that workers’ pension funds are recouped.
