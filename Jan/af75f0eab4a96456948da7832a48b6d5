eThekwini inconsistent on Zuma record deal 21 January 2019 The Democratic Alliance in eThekwini has noted with concern the inconsistencies from the city regarding former President Jacob Zuma’s ‘record deal’. The DA had written to City Manager, Sipho Nzuza, highlighting that this item had not been approved or considered by the eThekwini Council. Nzuza was encouraged to reign in Parks Unit Head, Thembinkosi Ngcobo, and put a stop to this ridiculous plan. His response was that a report would be prepared by the responsible Deputy City Manager and presented to the Full Council. Despite this, Ngcobo has publicly announced that the project will go ahead and that auditions will be held for back-up singers. In light of the further damning revelations in the Bosasa enquiry, which allege that Zuma was receiving an additional R300 000 per month in bribes, it is clear for all to see that he is not a man to be celebrated. The use of public money to further glorify a corrupt and morally reprehensible person cannot be justified. The Democratic Alliance urges the City Leadership to do the right thing and pull the plug on Ngcobo’s political schemes. eThekwini has descended into a cesspool of corruption and mismanagement, and Nzuza and his team urgently need to take control and get things back on track. The Democratic Alliance will not stand by and have eThekwini residents and ratepayers to be made a mockery of in this manner.
