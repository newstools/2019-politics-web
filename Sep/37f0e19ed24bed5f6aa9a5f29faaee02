Retrenchments at Sibanye-Stillwater’s Marikana operations part of Amcu and Ben Magara’s legacy 25 September 2019 Sibanye-Stillwater today informed trade unions that it plans to cut 5 270 jobs at its Marikana operations (former Lonmin mines. Of the 5 270 affected employees, 3 904 are permanent employees and 1 366 are contractors. While the company cites various reasons for the retrenchments, it is also clear that the affected employees are paying the price for Amcu’s devastating five-month strike in 2014 and former Lonmin CEO Ben Magara’s mismanagement. “Magara was more focused on keeping Amcu happy than focusing on the mines’ sustainability and effective management. As a result, Sibanye-Stillwater now has to deal with Magara’s mess, and innocent employees have to pay the price,” Solidarity General Secretary Gideon du Plessis said. Although the retrenchment notice comes as no surprise, Solidarity will do everything in its power to prevent retrenchments, or alternatively, will try to ensure that no forced retrenchments take place before the end of the year. "It would be insensitive if any employee has to receive a Christmas present in the form of a retrenchment package from Sibanye,” Du Plessis concluded.
