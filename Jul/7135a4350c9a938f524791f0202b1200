Gauteng Department of Social Development underspends by R400 million 20 July 2019 The Gauteng Department of Social Development (GDSD) has once again underspent on its budget for the fourth quarter. According to the department’s quarterly report for 2018/19 financial year, they have underspent by R400 million and have failed to reach their set targets. The under-expenditure occurred in Development and Research, Children and Families and Restorative Services. In Development and Research, the department underspent by R116.7 million, in the Children and Families category by R240.9 million and in Restorative Services by R39.3 million. This money could have been used to fund NGOs and NPOs who do much needed upliftment work in our communities, to employ more social workers and to purchase more resources like vehicles to aid department officials with their work. This is not the first time that the department has underspent its budget. Last year the department surrendered R347 million to the department, while NGOs and NPOs were struggling to stay afloat. I will be tabling questions to the MEC for Social Development in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature to ascertain what measures are being put in place to deal with the under-expenditure of the department so as to ensure that our people get the services they deserve.
