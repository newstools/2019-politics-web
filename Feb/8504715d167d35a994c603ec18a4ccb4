Supra court case - not even the courts can repair the broken and failing ANC bus 6 February 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in North West notes the High Court judgment today in the case of former Premier Supra Mahumapelo, contesting the national ANC's decision to disband the ANC’s North West Provincial Executive Committee (PEC). The court ruled Supra’s PEC be reinstated based on procedural irregularities. It goes to show that even in internal matters, the failing ANC cannot be trusted to deal with serious matters efficiently, and we know from our lived experiences in the North West, that the failing ANC cannot be trusted to govern in the interest of the people. The courts are unable to fix the failing and broken ANC bus. Only the DA can bring real change to the North West and build One South Africa for All. This year’s election is an opportunity to reject the ANC and usher in a new era of caring and responsive governance under a DA government. The destructive factionalism and division in the failing ANC are more rife than ever before. Nothing has changed in North West since Premier Mokgoro took over from disgraced former Premier Supra Mahumapelo. The ANC’s internal battles will continue to deny the people of North West the good governance and service delivery they are entitled to. The power to bring real change to the North West is in the hands of the people. Issued by Joe McGluwa, DA North West Premier Candidate, 6 February 2019
