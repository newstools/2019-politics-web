DA to serve ANC with cease and desist letter following theft of our Election slogan 11 January 2019 The Democratic Alliance’s (DA) lawyers will serve the ANC with a cease and desist letter to stop the governing party’s theft of our election slogan, “One South Africa for All”. The ANC has denied stealing the slogan, claiming it is impossible as the DA has not yet launched its election campaign. This is an outright lie as we launched our election campaign on 22 September 2018. The DA will also be demanding an apology from the ANC for stealing the slogan. We have proven our commitment to building a non-racial and inclusive South Africa while the ANC has, over the years, strayed from these ideals. It is therefore shameful that they would so brazenly parade themselves as being dedicated to building One South Africa for All when this couldn’t be further from the truth. The sheer lack of originality by the ANC shows that they have nothing to offer South Africans and is further motivation for our people to punish the ANC at the polls. On every indicator, the ANC has failed to create a South Africa where we all belong. Their politics is marred by deep racial division and the perpetuation of those who are included in the economy and those who are excluded. Inequality has been exacerbated by the organisation’s corruption in government and lack of political will to pull people out of the state-created poverty they find themselves in. Only the DA can realise the vision of One South Africa for All by making efforts at redressing past injustices, creating safe communities, growing an economy that will provide jobs and fighting for the property rights of all citizens. Voters have the power to help the DA realise the vision by registering to vote and removing the ANC from power. In the meantime, the ANC must desist from using the DA’s slogan or we will not hesitate to approach the courts. Issued by Solly Malatsi, DA National Spokesperson, 11 January 2019
