ACDP statement on Public Protector’s finding that Ramaphosa misled Parliament 19 July 2019 "The ACDP notes today’s finding by the Public Protector, Adv. Busisiwe Mkhwebane, that President Ramaphosa “deliberately” misled Parliament about a R500 000 donation he received from Bosasa. While we will be studying her report in full, we tend to agree that the President should have allowed himself sufficient time to prepare a well-informed response to the question posed by DA leader, Mr Maimane, on the 6 November 2018. However, it should be borne in mind that President Ramaphosa wrote to the then Speaker Mbete a few days after the question session, admitting he was wrong and that the money from Bosasa was actually a donation to his election campaign. The Public Protector’s finding that President Ramaphosa’s reply was in breach of the provisions of the Executive Ethics Code and, although ostensibly in good faith, is in violation of section 96(1) of the Constitution, is, however, very serious. In addition, the Public Protector has decided to refer allegations of money laundering relating to the way the money was paid, to the National Director of Public Prosecutions, Adv. Batohi, for further investigation. In view of the seriousness of these findings, and the fact that they are binding until reviewed and set aside by a court of law, the ACDP calls on the Speaker to establish an ad hoc committee of Parliament to consider the Public Protector’s report.” Issued by Keeno Petersen, Media Liaison Officer, ACDP, 19 July 2019
