DA to establish Transgender Units across Gauteng 4 April 2019 Today l conducted an oversight inspection at the Transgender Clinic situated within the premises of the Tlamelong Clinic in Mabopane, Tshwane. It is despicable that this is the only Transgender Clinic that caters for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBTIQ+) patients in Tshwane. This clinic is providing proper medical care and counselling to LGBTIQ+ patients. I met with some LGBTIQ+ patients who commended the good service they are getting from this clinic. They said nurses and staff members at this clinic don’t discriminate against them, and they are treated with care and dignity like any other human being. These skills exist partly due to a training partnership with a private donor. The LGBTIQ+’s plea to government is that other clinics that do not have a Transgender Unit are conscientized about LGBTIQ+ as patients experience severe discrimination in these clinics. The DA has consistently been advocating for the rights of the LGBT community and raising awareness of the issues they face. We are a Party for all and we are on a mission to build One South Africa for All. When DA governs Gauteng after the 8th May we will establish Transgender Units in all our health facilities to ensure that everyone gets treated with the dignity they deserve.
