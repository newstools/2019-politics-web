Ex-SARS commissioner Oupa Magashula to institute urgent review proceedings against Public Protector 25 May 2019 Our client, Mr. Oupa Magashula has instructed that we immediately institute review proceedings against the Public Protector’s report and recommendations that she published yesterday. 1. Mr. Magashula was subpoenaed to give evidence in the enquiry in late March 2019. 2. He was subsequently provided with the Public Protector’s provisional report in late April 2019,   and invited to respond with written submissions within 21 days. 3. Further submissions were duly filed with the Public Protector on 21 May 2019, and Mr Magashula has authorized a copy of the document be attached hereto. 4. The indecent haste with which the Public Protector then made public her findings on the 24th of May 2019 is in our client’s view an indication of the fact that little and/or no regard was had to the evidence and supplementary submissions. 5. Her findings in our view arise from the erroneous application of the facts, and an erroneous understanding of the law. Our office has instructions to prepare a review application to the High Court on an urgent basis. Issued by PF Viljoen from Savage Jooste and Adams, 25 May 2019
