Arrest of Ndobe confirms that ANC is a criminal syndicate 18 March 2019 The Democratic Alliance is not shocked by the arrest of ANC Harry Gwala Municipality Mayor, Mluleko Ndobe, in connection with the murder of Sindiso Magaqa. The DA has long stated that the ANC harbors criminals. The Moerane Commission also revealed this fact. The arrest of Ndobe highlights what we have been saying all along that political hits are the result of internal ANC fights and corruption. During the passing of Magaqa, it was reported that the family of Magaqa refused Ndobe entry to Magaqa's home. The passing of Magaqa was allegedly linked to corruption at the municipality which was described as rife and the Harry Gwala regional conference. We call upon the law to take its course in this matter, in the meantime, the ANC must remove tainted Ndobe from its list whilst this matter is before the court. The Moerane Commission recommended that “political parties discipline their members whose conduct encourages or results in political violence and where their members are involved in or are accomplices to killings they must report these members to the relevant law enforcement authorities” we hope that the ANC will show leadership on this matter. The DA will be out in numbers tomorrow when he appears in court to see if justice is served. Issued by Zwakele Mncwango, KZN Premier Candidate, 18 March 2019
