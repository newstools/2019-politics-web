High Court ruling reaffirms questions about Mkhwebane’s fitness for office 12 August 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) notes the Pretoria High Court granting President Cyril Ramaphosa an interim interdict to have the implementation of the Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s remedial action against him suspended, pending a judicial review of the Bosasa report. While the DA believes that the President has a case to answer for and that he must be held to account - we respect the Court’s ruling and will abide by this decision. Our obligation is to the public and the Constitution. The rule of law is sacrosanct, and if the President believes he has done nothing wrong, then he is well within his rights to take this matter on review and to obtain an interdict. Today’s ruling does, however, raise questions about Mkhwebane’s fitness for office and is a further blow to her credibility. It cannot be that the Public Protector staggers from one defeat to the next on an almost weekly basis. The High Court decision reaffirms the DA’s position that Mkhwebane needs to be removed. While we respect the authority of the Office of the Public Protector and the Constitutional role it serves, we have serious concerns over the competence and independence of the incumbent. In her almost three years in office, she has on numerous occasions showed the public that she is wholly unsuitable for office. The DA reiterates its call that Parliament expedite removal proceedings in Mkhwebane. The longer she remains in office, the more she will erode the nation’s faith in this very crucial Chapter 9 institution.
