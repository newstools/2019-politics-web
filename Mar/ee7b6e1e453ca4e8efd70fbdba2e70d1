DA meets with the Simelanes: Babes Wodumo needs our support 7 March 2019 The DA in KwaZulu met with the sister and manager of Bongekile Simelane commonly known as Babes Wodumo to offer comfort, support and give reassurance that we are on her side following this horrible ordeal she went through. This follows a video that went viral this week where Bongekile Simelane was seen severely beaten by her partner Mandla Maphumulo, known as Mampintsha. In our meeting, it became clear that Babes and the entire family are currently not in a good state. What also became clear is that Mampintsha is using every possible means to discredit the victim and assassinate her character. We are hopeful that our support to the victim will give strength to her as she goes through this ordeal. We call upon the South African community to support the Simelane family during this difficult time. Too often, victims of abuse are left with no choice but to withdraw charges against the abuser because of either lack of support or trust in the criminal justice system. Victims time and again have to wait for lengthy periods to realise full justice on such matters. It is for this reason that we call upon the South African Police Service and the courts to use this case as an opportunity to showcase the strength of the criminal justice system and give back hope to the millions of women who face abuse on a daily basis. The DA is committed to a South Africa that is free from crime and with a professional police service who do their work honestly and with the diligence it requires no matter who the perpetrator is.
