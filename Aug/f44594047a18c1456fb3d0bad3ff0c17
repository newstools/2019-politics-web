DA calls for release of report into asbestos classrooms 26 August 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) has submitted a Promotion Of Access To Information Act 2 of 2000 (PAIA) application, to force the Minister of Employment and Labour, Thulas Nxesi, to release a report into the asbestos classrooms at the Chloorkop Primary School. In a reply to a Parliamentary question in 2018, the former Minister of Labour, Mildred Oliphant, stated that, a full report can be made available to me after I had requested one. Shockingly, when I requested the report through a further Parliamentary question in 2019, the Minister reneged on her promise arguing that section 36 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 85 of 1993 “prohibits disclosure of any information concerning the affairs of any other person obtained in carrying out any function in terms of the Act.” In 2013, the Department of Basic Education adopted school infrastructure norms and standards regulations which stipulated that all schools built entirely of asbestos had to be replaced by 29 November 2016. However upon my request to inspect the Chloorkop Primary School, the Department of Labour found that there was non-compliance with certain provisions of the asbestos regulations. The extent of these transgressions and the possible negative impact, if any, on the learners, teachers and parents is unknown. It is for this reason that the Department of Employment and Labour should make the report public. Hiding information from parents and teachers will not be tolerated. Parents and teachers alike need to know which regulations are not being complied with to be aware of any possible dangers. The DA will ensure that the report is released to the public and that the department considers asbestos a health hazard, which is unacceptable.
