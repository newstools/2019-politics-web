Refuting document circulating on social media 9 January 2019 We have noted with dismay that there is a document entitled "ANC CRISIS FOR URGENT RESOLUTION" circulating on social media, in which our names are mentioned. We have no knowledge about how this document came about, and only became aware of its existence once it started being distributed on social media. We have never been part of any meetings alluded to in the document. We distance ourselves unequivocally from its contents. Issued by Carl Niehaus and Justice Piitso, 9 January 2019
