EFF STATEMENT ON eNCA Thursday, 19 December 2019 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));The EFF condemns the eNCA for its racist treatment of African joumalists. In a tweet, one of its managers called a journalist Samkele Maseko a rat on social media, after firing him. We also have reliable information that eNCA placed Khayelihle Khumalo under suspension for tweeting about the EFF Second National People's Assembly (NPA) from his personal account. The EFF condemns these actions as a sign of total deterioration of leadership, principles and ethics within the eNCA. In fact, when it comes to the EFF, the institution has become personal. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0']));It is a fact that the eNCA was always looking for a way to avoid covering the EFF Second NPA. This is because from day one, when all other broadcasters built set onsite, eNCA never built a set or brought any technical equipment signifying their full commitment to cover the EFF Second NPA. Their withdrawal must be seen for what it truly represents: an attempt to silence the EFF. South Africans must unite in totally boycotting eNCA, both from watching it and attending to its news requests and events. No one must call an African child a rat in our country and it just becomes business as usual. It is also shocking how silent and completely absent SANEF is in dealing the eNCA and its abuse of journalists. In particular the racism expressed by its manager (possibly head of news) Kanthan Pillay, who is a leader of Purple Cow, a political party registered with IEC. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2',114,'0','0']));Had it been a white journalist who was treated the way Samkele Maseko and Khayelihle Khumalo testified, SANEF would be vocal and even calling on immediate investigations. Their silence must be read as being complicit with racism and total disregard of journalistic ethics when it comes to African people.
