POPCRU welcomes cabinet appointees within the criminal justice cluster 30 May 2019 The Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union (POPCRU) welcomes the new cabinet appointments by President Cyril Ramaphosa, and is particularly elated over the retaining of Mr Bheki Cele as Minister of Police, the appointment of Mr Ronald Lamola as Minister of Justice and Correctional Services, and that of Ms Ayanda Dlodlo as the Minister of State Security. In his statement, President Ramaphosa categorically stressed on the need to have a capable, efficient and ethical government that can optimally meet the needs of the people and ensure the most efficient allocation of public resources, and the need to build a modern, developmental state that has the means to drive economic and social transformation. The criminal justice cluster has been under immense strain for over a decade now, with continued infightings, high levels of crime rates and police killings, overcrowding, understaffing and looting within our correctional centres, impartial prosecutions and lack of capacity within the NPA. This new era brings about an opportune moment to remedy this past trend, and we have full confidence in that the appointed Ministers, working together with all stakeholders, can achieve the much needed stability we seek within the criminal justice cluster. We look forward to working closely with all these ministries towards transforming the criminal justice cluster in defence of the working class struggle for the advancement of the national democratic revolution.
