Suspension of Red Ants registration opens door for illegal occupations 2 July 2019 The suspension of the Red Ants’ registration with the private security industry regulatory body (Prisa) is alarming and opens the door for illegal land occupations and land grabs. According to media reports, it seems that Psira gave in to political pressure to take action against the Red Ants after the recent removal of illegal occupants and demolition of illegal structures in Alexandra. It is significant that the EFF immediately welcomed the fact that action was taken against the Red Ants. Psira stated in a press release that the Red Ants, a private security and eviction company, acted callously with the demolition of structures and that lead to the violation of the human rights of the people of Alexandra. The Red Ants usually only take action after obtaining a warrant and the FF Plus assumes that the company did that in this case as well so the party, therefore, sees no grounds for the allegation that the company acted outside of its mandate. The fact that the company's hands are now tied opens the door for large-scale land occupations and municipal land is particularly under threat. Open spaces like parks can now be illegally occupied and if the occupants are not removed within the specified time, the problem can escalate very quickly. The action taken against the Red Ants has also bound the hands of city councils seeing as the Red Ants were widely used to resolve illegal occupations. The municipal authorities do not have the ability to resolve these problems themselves. This is yet another example of where those who abide by the law are punished while law breakers go unpunished. This can have serious consequences and the FF Plus will keep a close eye on the Red Ants’ legal action against its suspension so as to ensure that justice prevails.
