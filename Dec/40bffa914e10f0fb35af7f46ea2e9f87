PSA calls on the President to immediately release the PIC report The Public Servants Association (PSA) calls on President Cyril Ramaphosa to immediately release the report of the judicial commission inquiry into Public Investment Corporation (PIC). eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0']));The PSA represents hundred thousands of public servants and has been key in calling for PIC reforms including diversification of its mandate. The PSA has been critical of these undue delays in completing the commission's mandate and the apparent bias in favour of big corporations and apparent slunder and targeting of black owned enterprises. The PIC Commission has finally submitted the findings of the inquiry into the state-owned asset manager by 15 December 2019 to the President which was the extended deadline set to complete the task. The PSA is of the view that the release of the report would give majority of public servants, pensioners and beneficiaries a sense of relief and understanding of the state of the PIC where their hard-earned livelihoods are invested. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));The PSA believes strongly that the immediate release of the report will curb ongoing speculations of the outcomes as well as leaks that are quite unfortunate and undermine the commission process and integrity. To avoid the report being compromised and as a gesture of goodwill and to promote transparency, the PSA requests Cyril Ramaphosa to urgently release the findings from the commission. Mr President release the report immediately and give the public servants well deserved Christmas present. Statement issued by the PSA, 19 December 2019
