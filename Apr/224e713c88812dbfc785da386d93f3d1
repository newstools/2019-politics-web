Sick people sent home as ANC government fails to manage clinic 29 April 2019 The Democratic Alliance in the Northern Cape is making an urgent call on the Health Department to urgently intervene in the issues at the Ritchie clinic that saw personnel down tools today. Unhappiness amongst employees relating to empty promises of permanent employment, have come to a head, with all staff, including nurses, shutting down the facility. In effect, almost 200 people, including the elderly patients and mothers with babies, were left to stand outside. These sick people need health services and they have nowhere else to go to get alternative medical help. They have been left in the lurch while the failing ANC government plays with their lives. The uncaring health department has been turning a blind eye to the growing concerns of staff. After 25-years of ANC governance, the wheels are coming off and the public health sector is on the verge of a standstill due to mismanagement, corruption and a failure by the department to iron out challenges at health facilities across the province. It is time for change. The ANC couldn’t fix health services in a quarter of a century, another five years under them will cause a complete collapse of the health system in the province. Only a DA government can speed up service delivery and ensure that access to quality health care is drastically increased across the Northern Cape.
