DA condemns Emfuleni’s unfair WhatsApp recruitment process 27 June 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) condemns in the strongest terms the Emfuleni Local Municipality’s unfair WhatsApp recruitment process. The DA is in possession of a WhatsApp message from the office of the Emfuleni MMC for Public Safety, Cllr Motshana Jan Moshoaluba that has been circulating amongst the councillors. The message reads, “Ward Councillors are hereby requested to submit 7 CV’s for the Pointsmen Project. Proof of residence, signed by the Ward Councillor must be attached to each CV. The CV’s together with the proof of residence may be emailed to: marindaba@emfuleni.gov.za . The closing date will be Tuesday 2 July 2019. Thank you, From the Office of MMC Moshoaluba”. The fact that Ward Councillors must submit CV’s on behalf of the residents opens the recruitment process to corruption. The municipality must follow the proper recruitment processes of advertising jobs so that people who are competent and meet the requirements have access to these opportunities. We call on the Gauteng MEC for COGTA, Lebogang Maile to investigate the authenticity of this WhatsApp message. Should it be found that the WhatsApp message is indeed from the office of the MMC, the position must be re-advertised properly and those implicated must be dealt with accordingly. Unemployment is a serious issue in South Africa, which had to be dealt with fairly. The DA believes that a lottery system is the only solution to ensure fair access to jobs. The lottery system is free from political manipulation and will ensure that everyone has an equal chance of getting a job. Issued by Kingsol Chabalala, DA Emfuleni Constituency Head, 27 June 2019
