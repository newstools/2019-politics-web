DA sets the record straight on corrupt farm deals in Tshwane 10 October 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) would like to set the record straight about recent misleading reports regarding the corrupt purchase of the Strydfontein, Klipfontein and Roodepoort farms in the City of Tshwane. Most significantly, these purchases and the negotiations thereof happened prior to the DA taking over the administration of the city in 2016 when it was under the control of the ANC. This corruption happened during former Tshwane Mayor, Sputla Ramokgopa's tenure. This was way before the DA's time in office. We welcome the DA-led City of Tshwane Mayor, Stevens Mokgalapa's response to investigate these deals and act against anyone found to be corrupt. According to media reports the negotiations for the corrupt sales took place between the municipality and certain multimillion-rand companies that allegedly acted as middle-men. The companies allegedly bought the farms from their original owners, and sold them hours later to the City of Tshwane for millions more than the original price. Strydfontein was bought for R117million but sold to the city for R211million, Klipfontein was bought for R53million but sold to the city for R85.5million all on the same day. The Roodepoort 504 farm in Bronkhorstspruit was sold for R40million from its original owner and sold to the city forty days later for R90 million. The DA is determined to get to the bottom of what happened here and do its upmost to ensure those responsible pay back the money if found guilty. Only the DA can bring change that builds one SA for all. Issued by John Moodey, DA Gauteng Provincial Leader, 10 October 2019
