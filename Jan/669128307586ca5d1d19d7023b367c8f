Janusz Waluś does not deserve parole for the murder of Chris Hani – SACP 16 January 2019 The SACP has noted the decision announced on Wednesday, 16 January 2019, by Advocate Michael Masutha, Minister of Justice and Correctional Services, on the application for parole brought by Janusz Waluś, the cold-blooded and unrehabilitated murderer of Comrade Chris Hani, SACP General Secretary at the time he was murdered. The convicted murderer asserts that he has no remorse for murdering Chris Hani the Communist, but claims to be having remorse for murdering Chris Hani the husband and father, as if Chris Hani the Communist was not the same Chris Hani the husband and father whom he murdered. The SACP strongly condemns the unremorseful and unrehabilitated murderer, Janusz Waluś. Chris Hani the Communist was indivisibly Chris Hani the husband and father. By the way murder remains unjustifiable, whether it is the murder of a Communist or a husband and father. Chris Hani chose to become a Communist and embarked in the liberation struggle for human, socio-economic and political rights which had to be and are now accordingly enshrined in our country’s Constitution. Waluś does not deserve parole. He remains a danger in our society. What he deserves is to rot in jail for so long as he tries to justify the murder of Chris Hani, and for so long as all the circumstances surrounding the murder have not been fully disclosed or uncovered. The SACP will continue to legally fight for justice for Chris Hani. Issued by Alex Mohubetswane Mashilo, National Spokesperson & Head of Communications, 16 January 2019
