Deputy President David Mabuza welcomes the court judgement on the use of the apartheid flag 21 August 2019 Deputy President David Mabuza, as Patron of the Moral Regeneration Movement, welcomes the judgment by Deputy Judge President of the South Gauteng Division of the High Court, Justice Pheneas Mojapelo on the use of the apartheid flag. Justice Mojapelo ruled in the Equality Court that “the gratuitous display of the apartheid flag, demonstrates a clear intention to be hurtful, harmful and incites harm, promotes and incites hatred against black people.” The judgment amongst others, sets the right tone for all South Africans to work towards building a South Africa of their dreams. A South Africa whose very foundation is centered on equality, as well as civil and political freedoms. A South Africa that is non-racial, non-sexist and is not held to any form of past bondages and symbols that undermine these values. The judgment further reaffirms the supremacy of the constitution and the centrality of national unity, nation building and social cohesion. It rekindles the vigour with which all South Africans must intensify their commitment to building a united and prosperous South Africa. What the judgment does, is to unambiguously communicate that no rights are above other rights. “The project of Nation Building by its nature has elements of fragility. Therefore in our efforts to heal the wounds of the past and building a society that is cohesive, we must at all material times be mindful of our actions, especially as they relate to the pain and scars inflicted by the past,” said Deputy President Mabuza. Deputy President has been delegated by the President the responsibility of facilitating social cohesion initiatives and being patron of the Moral Regeneration Movement.
