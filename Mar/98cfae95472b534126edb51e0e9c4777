Malema’s comments on the Indian community proves EFF seeks to divide SA 25 March 2019 EFF Leader, Julius Malema’s comments over the weekend regarding the Indian community is once again proof that the EFF is populist party which thrives on exclusion and hate. The issues facing the country are complex but require a level a political maturity that is geared towards uniting and working with all South Africans. This is not the first time Malema has spewed racial bile about the Indian community for election outcomes. The EFF is not committed to building One South Africa for All. Instead, it is a party which campaigns on slandering one group over another and vilifying communities on the basis of race. South Africa is a country fractured along racial lines and political leaders such as Malema should play an integral role in the project of reconciliation. Yet, Malema chooses to instead spew racial vitriol and division. The EFF clearly has no clear policy offer for the people South Africa so it will campaign on popular and dangerous rhetoric. These comments which seek to stereotype all Indian South Africans has no place in a constitutional democracy. And speaks to the lack of political maturity within the EFF. The DA is the only party which is committed to building One South Africa, unlike the EFF that seek to divide our people on the basis of race.
