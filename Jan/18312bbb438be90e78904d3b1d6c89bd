Ramaphosa ignores Esidimeni victims 14 January 2019 The Democratic Alliance notes that ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa made no reference in his Manifesto speech on Saturday to the Life Esidimeni tragedy even though many victims have still not received the promised compensation. Ramaphosa steered clear of acknowledging and apologizing for what has been described as the worst human rights abuse since apartheid, with 144 deaths of the most vulnerable people in our society. Recompense for the tragedy is still incomplete as there are delays in paying about 200 victims monetary compensation as determined by Justice Dikgang Moseneke’s arbitration award. Furthermore, 21 former Esidimeni patients are still missing, many of whom are probably dead in an unmarked grave. The ongoing tragedy is that mental health patients in Gauteng and other provinces continue to receive sub-standard care in poor facilities, and waiting lists are long. It is yet another example of the failing ANC’s dire failure to provide quality health care even as doubtful promises are made to improve in future. The failing ANC is killing our people. The power to bring change and build One South Africa for All that ensures that all our people are treated with dignity lies in the hands of voters.
