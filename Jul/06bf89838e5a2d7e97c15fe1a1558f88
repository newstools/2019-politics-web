DA calls on Gauteng Government to urgently intervene in housing crisis in Lenasia South 23 July 2019 Ugly scenes played themselves out in Lenasia South when residents living in shacks marched through the area and resorted to threats of violence and stone-throwing as they protested about unsatisfactory housing conditions in the area. The march was allegedly in response to protests the previous day by Lenasia South residents who complained about the lack of action from government in dealing with illegal settlements. Despite an undertaking from the ANC provincial government that land grabs would not be tolerated, the situation has been allowed to spiral out of control. This has resulted in residents of surrounding areas such as Lenasia, Lenasia South, Zakariyya Park and Ennerdale being subjected to frequent water and electricity outages, environmental degradation and increased crime. In addition, the City of Johannesburg loses revenue as a result of the theft of water and electricity and the infrastructure is damaged. Residents are being prejudiced by the ANC government’s failure to provide housing, adequate infrastructure, services and to enforce the law. Politicians responsible for causing the problem must now urgently intervene to ensure that those enriching themselves through the misery of others are brought to book. We urge the Gauteng Provincial Government to accede to the request by DA Johannesburg Mayor, Herman Mashaba to work with the City in Lenasia to ensure that residents receive dignified housing and reliable services.
