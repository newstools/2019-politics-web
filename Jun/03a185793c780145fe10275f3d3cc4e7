DA calls on MEC Molapisi to resign immediately following allegations of R700 000 in kickbacks 26 June 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in North West calls for the immediate resignation of MEC for Public Works and Roads, Oagile Molapisi after he was implicated in the dodgy SA Express deal during the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture last week. It is alleged that the MEC received kickbacks in the amount of R700 000 for signing a five-year contract with SA Express to revive Mahikeng- and Pilanesberg Airports. Ever since the whistle blower exposed the dubious dealings between SA Express, the Premier’s Office and Department of Community Safety and Transport in 2018 involving payment of R50 million before the contract was even signed, no action has been taken. The fact that the North West Provincial Legislature’s Portfolio Committee on Community Safety and Transport Management never probed the matter is however not surprising, because MEC Molapisi was the Chairperson at the time that the matter came into the public domain. After his removal as MEC for Department of Community Safety and Transport in 2017, he was conveniently appointed as the chairperson of the committee that oversees the work of the department he was removed from. With the sword of allegations of this nature hanging over his head, it is prudent that the MEC resigns in honour of his oath of office and out of respect for the citizens of this province. The DA will write to Premier Mokgoro requesting him to weed out unscrupulous individuals from his cabinet and also to ensure that those implicated in any corrupt activity, be criminally charged.
