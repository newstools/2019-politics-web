Newly established NW ANC interim committee another pointless PR stunt 12 August 2019 The newly established ANC Interim Provincial Committee is yet another pointless PR stunt that shows that the ANC is not serious about tackling corruption and improving service delivery in the North West. Rather, its interest is in the protection of corrupt politicians. On Sunday the ANC lauded its newly established interim Provincial Committee and promised it would deal with service delivery challenges, creating jobs and stabilising municipalities. However, the inclusion of former North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo, Speaker Susan Dantjie, former MEC Johannes Tselapedi and Zakes Tolo in the committee shows that the ANC is not serious about bringing good governance and improving service delivery in the province. These individuals sat over the looting of state resources to benefit ANC cadres and saw to the collapse of both local and provincial government. The ANC cannot expect to bring change by employing the same people who looted and collapsed governance in this province. Supra and his cronies will not bring change or better the lives of the people of North West. Instead of decisively dealing with corruption and mismanagement the ANC is establishing yet another pointless committee to create the illusion of change. There have been a countless number of interim committees and task teams and yet no real results or improvements have come out of it. Instead, the provincial government and 15 municipalities remain under administration. As the ANC tries to deal with pleasing different factions within its ranks, it is the people of the North West who continue to suffer without basic services. Only a DA-government can bring change that will fight corruption, create jobs and speed up the delivery of basic services. Where the DA governs in the Western Cape we are already bringing good governance and accountability to our people. Issued byÂ Joe McGluwa, DA NW Provincial Leader, 12 August 2019
