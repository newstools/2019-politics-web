Increasingly people acknowledge that the DA is the only party that is truly committed to building One South Africa for All, underpinned by our values of Freedom, Fairness, Opportunity and Diversity. Tese members have joined our party because they believe that the DA can bring real change to South Africa and they want to be a part of this important cause. It is encouraging to see so many new members as well as former members who have returned to the DA. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));It’s no secret that we have a faced a number of challenges in the last few weeks but we will not forfeit accountability for comfort. The party has reflected and begun to address these challenges and despite the difficulties, we remain resolute to serve the people of our country. Our brand of good governance is still the driving force of our party and we want to deliver quality services to all residents of this province. I am humbled and grateful to the leaders and members who have joined us today for this homecoming celebration. Our vision of a non-racial, inclusive South Africa will be realised. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_7',114,'0','0']));We will now embark on a province wide campaign to recruit more members and renew the mandate of our structures through Annual General Meetings in preparation for our Federal Congress in 2020. More importantly, we will intensify service delivery to our communities as per the mandate afforded to us in May this year. Our preparation for the 2021 Local Government elections must be about service delivery. I invite all the new DA members to join our campaign efforts this coming week as we contest three by-elections in the province on the 13th of November. This will be a perfect opportunity to get involved and be a part of the blue machine.
