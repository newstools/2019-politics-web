Ramaphosa scared of debating Maimane 17 April 2019 The ANC has today confirmed that President Ramaphosa is running scared of debating DA Leader, Mmusi Maimane. Yesterday, the SABC’s Big Debate Show invited both Mmusi Maimane and Cyril Ramaphosa to a televised presidential debate on Sunday 28 April. Mmusi Maimane has welcomed this great initiative and indicated that he was ready and looking forward to going head-to-head with the current President. Today, the ANC has confirmed that Cyril Ramaphosa is afraid of facing up to the DA Leader. He has again confirmed more empty promises of transparency and accountability, just like his empty promises of acting against corruption. It has been 25 years since the last presidential debate in South Africa. Since then, the ANC has denied the people of South Africa a proper contest of ideas between its Presidential Candidate and DA Leaders. Cyril Ramaphosa’s retreat into the safety of Luthuli House confirms that he is no different from his predecessors.  He is simply afraid of accounting for Marikana, Bosasagate and the ANC’s inability to create jobs. Only Mmusi Maimane and the DA can bring change that builds One South Africa for All and puts a job in every home. We look forward to bringing this change on 08 May.
