Democracy and popular political norms in South Africa (I) - To what degree do popular political perceptions correlate with basic Constitutional norms? 5 March 2019 INTRODUCTION The Constitution spells out a considerable number of norms for South Africa’s democracy.  This brief considers the extent to which popular South African political opinions conform to or differ from these constitutional norms.  Data are taken from the Afrobarometer[1] Round 6 South African Survey, conducted in 2015.  The Survey contains over a hundred questions.  The focus here is on sixteen of them, relating to democracy and governance.  They are set out in Appendix 1.  For each question, one can identify responses that conform to constitutional norms. ANALYSIS If we add up the constitution conforming responses to these 16 questions for each respondent, the median score is 12.  The score at the 25th percentile is 10, and the score at the 75th percentile is 13.  The entire distribution of the scores is presented in Figure 1.  Next, consider the percentage of respondents who return a constitution conforming response to each question.  Table 1 sets out the information, ordered by percentage. Table 1: Constitutional conformity by question (per cent) Q30b * Unwilling to live under non-elected government 34 Q33 Many parties needed 41 Q31 * Prefer accountability to speed of decisions 51 Q34 * President monitored by parliament 62 Q30 * Democracy preferable 64 Q28b * Reject military rule 67 Q36 Investigative media 70 Q28a * Reject one-party rule 72 Q37 Parliament makes laws 76 Q28d * Reject return to apartheid 77 Q32 * Regular elections 77 Q38 * President must obey laws 77 Q39 * Two term limit 78 Q28c * Reject one-man rule 80 Q29e * Positive or neutral views about democracy 88 Q29a * Understand democracy 95 The very low score for Q30b and the low scores for Q33 and Q31 are noteworthy and they will be considered in detail in the second brief in this series. How does the mean conformity score vary by population group and socio-economic status[2]?  Table 2 presents the results for the average constitution conformity scores by population group and socio-economic status. Table 2: Mean constitutional conformity scores by population group and socio-economic status (per cent) Socio-economic status Black Coloured Asian White All Poorest 20% 11.4 10.4 10.6 11.6 11.6 Next 20% 11.6 11.0 13.0 11.5 11.5 Middle 20% 11.4 10.6 10.8 10.7 10.7 Next 20% 11.5 11.0 11.6 10.9 10.9 Richest 20% 11.8 10.5 11.4 11.0 11.0 All 11.5 10.7 11.4 11.0 11.4 There are no significant differences[3] between the scores by socio-economic group.  The scores by population group are significantly different, with Coloured and White mean scores lower than Black scores.  Nonetheless, more than 98% of the variance in scores is within individual population groups, and less than 2% is accounted for by variance between groups. Differences by population group show up when it comes to individual questions.  The asterisks in Table 1 indicate the questions for which significant differences were found in the population proportions returning a constitutionally conforming response.  A table setting out the differences appears in Appendix 3.  But, as in the case for the differences in mean scores, less than 2% of the variance in response is accounted for by group differences. Up to this point, the focus has been simply on the degree to which the various answers can be regarded as in line with constitutional norms.  But do the responses to individual questions indicate coherent conceptions of democracy?  The next brief deals with that question.

Question Number: Q5 Question: In general, how do you rate your living conditions compared to those of other South Africans? Value Labels: 1=Much worse, 2=Worse, 3=Same, 4=Better, 5=Much better Question Number: Q8A Question: Over the past year, how often, if ever, have you or anyone in your family: Gone without enough food to eat? Value Labels: 0=Never, 1=Just once or twice, 2=Several times, 3=Many times, 4=Always Question Number: Q8C Question: Over the past year, how often, if ever, have you or anyone in your family: Gone without medicines or medical treatment? Value Labels: 0=Never, 1=Just once or twice, 2=Several times, 3=Many times, 4=Always Question Number: Q8E Question: Over the past year, how often, if ever, have you or anyone in your family: Gone without a cash income? Value Labels: 0=Never, 1=Just once or twice, 2=Several times, 3=Many times, 4=Always Question Number: Q97 Question: What is your highest level of education? Value Labels: 0=No formal schooling, 1=Informal schooling only (including Koranic schooling), 2=Some primary schooling, 3=Primary school completed, 4=Intermediate school or Some secondary school / high school, 5=Secondary school / high school completed, 6=Post-secondary qualifications, other than university e.g. a diploma or degree from a polytechnic or college, 7=Some university, 8=University completed, 9=Post-graduate For the technically minded: - In all cases, the values are set so that the lowest represents the lowest socio-economic status - The response options are ordered categorical, so the appropriate way of obtaining a correlation matrix is by using a polychoric method. - Factor analysis can then be applied to the correlation matrix and the first factor is interpreted as an indicator of socio-economic status. - The indicator so obtained is continuous, and the observations are divided into five quintiles.

[2] To answer the second part of the question, it is necessary to construct an index of socio-economic status from other variables within the Survey.  The method used is outlined in Appendix 2. [3] at the 5% level.  There is a difference between ‘significant’ and ‘substantial’.  Significance is related to sampling error, while a substantial difference refers to the size of gap between categories, for instance, the gap between the mean score for one population group
