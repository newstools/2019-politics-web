ANC fight against corruption is mere political rhetoric 3 April 2019 The IFP notes the book, “Gangster State: Unravelling Ace Magashule’s web of Capture”,which alleges that Ace Magashule engaged in illegal dealings during his tenure as Free State Premier. The IFP believes that the ANC’s fight against corruption is mere political rhetoric. If the ANC was serious about corruption it should have instructed its Secretary General, Ace Magashule, to step aside and deal with his alleged corruption issues. He should be suspended. The failure to act on one thing simply means it will never act on anything where corruption is concerned as evidenced in the manner this issue was handled. It is an undisputed fact that the ANC is good at defending its suspected corrupt individuals rather than to hold them to account for their actions. The ANC is also good in rewarding its questionable cadres with senior positions. The IFP has a good track record of good governance in KwaZulu-Natal. The fight against corruption in South Africa continues to remain a pipedream, it is only the IFP which will change this and address the scourge of corruption across the board. The IFP further notes that the anti-graft fight in South Africa has been undermined due to the invisible hands interfering in the operations of the institutions that are legally mandated to curb corrupt practices in South Africa. To deal with corruption accordingly, the IFP believes that South Africa would be well served to establish a Corruption Court to deal with various allegations related to transgressions of the PFMA, MFMA and other Treasury Regulations and Auditor General findings in order to fast-track cases and to ensure that justice is served swiftly. The IFP challenges the ANC Secretary General to show leadership qualities by voluntarily stepping aside to deal with his “smalanyana skeletons”.
