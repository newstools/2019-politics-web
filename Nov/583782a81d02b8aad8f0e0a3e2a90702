EFF statement of solidarity with SAA workers 14 November 2019 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));The EFF sends its revolutionary solidarity to all the workers of South African Airways who are facing looming job losses. The workers have communicated that they will embark on tools down demonstrations from Friday the 15th of November in defense of their jobs. The EFF not only supports the strike action, we will join in together with our ground forces. The failure of SAA must be put squarely on the Ramaphosa and Gordhan government; they have failed to stabilise the SOE. They have been presiding over the government for two years now and SAA like other SOE's (e.g. Eskom) is continuing to deteriorate. They have no plan to save state institutions and the broader economic conditions of high unemployment. Ramaphosa keeps misleading the country with investment conferences that promise billions of Rands that no one feels on the ground. If there are billions in investment, why is SAA planning to retrench workers? eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0']));We call on workers to unite and fight against retrenchments. The failure of SAA cannot be blamed on ordinary workers; they cannot be the ones who take responsibility by losing jobs that support their families and relatives. We call on all progressive forces in South Africa, families and relatives of all workers in SAA to join in the demonstrations and fight against job losses. If needs be, all Airports must be shut down, until SAA guarantees jobs for all SAA workers. Issued by Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, National Spokesperson, EFF, 14 November 2019
