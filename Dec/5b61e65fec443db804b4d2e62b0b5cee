Eskom unreservedly apologises to South Africans as Stage 6 rotational loadshedding shifts back to Stage 4 from 22:00 today until 23:00 on Tuesday 9 December 2019 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));This afternoon, as generating unit breakdowns remained high, the power supply to the incline conveyors feeding coal to the silos at Medupi Power Station failed, further contributing to the shortage in capacity. The technical teams worked around the clock and have resumed coal handling operations at Medupi Power Station.   As a result, Stage 6 rotational loadshedding was stopped at 22:00 tonight. Eskom resumed Stage 4 loadshedding from 22:00 today until 23:00 on Tuesday, 10 December 2019. “Eskom unreservedly apologises to all South Africans for the inconvenience during this difficult period. In addition, we remain grateful to large power users for their invaluable assistance offered today,” said Jabu Mabuza, Eskom’s Acting Group Chief Executive and Interim Executive Chairman. We will keep South Africans informed about the status of the electricity system and our recovery efforts throughout this period. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0']));Eskom customers can check their loadshedding schedules on the Eskom website (loadshedding.eskom.co.za) or through the customer contact centre on 0860037566.
