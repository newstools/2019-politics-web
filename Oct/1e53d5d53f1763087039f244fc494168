It is alleged that the employees have been using the quarters for several years and that it was against the Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Act 85 of 1993. Section 8 of the act states that the employer is obliged to provide and maintain a workplace that is safe and without risk to the health of their employees.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2',114,'0','0'])); "We have since identified and allocated a suitable room to be utilised by the employees," Mabona said. Mabona said the department implored schools to familiarise themselves with OHS policies and to adhere to fair labour practices at all times.
