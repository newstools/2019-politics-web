It is one of the biggest reasons why state hospitals are in such a terrible condition. The FF Plus pointed out to the Minister and the Department that people are consequently losing their lives in state hospitals and it is utterly destroying the Department's vision and mission, which in short goes: "A Long and Healthy Life for all South Africans".
