Defence and Military Veterans and Police Committee Chairperson welcomes deployment of SANDF to Cape Flats 12 July 2019 The Chairpersons of the Portfolio Committee on Defence and Military Veterans, as well as the Portfolio Committee on Police, welcome the deployment of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) to gang-ridden areas on the Cape Flats. The decision to deploy the SANDF to gang-ridden areas on the Cape Flats was announced yesterday by Police Minister, General Bheki Cele. Both Chairpersons, Mr Cyril Xaba and Ms Tina Joemat-Pettersson, believe that this inter-governmental collaboration between the SANDF and the South African Police Service (SAPS) could play a major role in addressing the challenge of violence, which not only saw 13 people lose their lives in the Philippi area last weekend, but the countless loss of innocent lives. Community members in places such as Bonteheuwel, Mitchells Plain, Philippi and Hanover Park, among other places, have been tortured and lived in fear for far too long. On many occasions, children are unable to go to school, and on far too many occasions innocent people have lost their lives when caught up in the cross-fire between gangs. In saying this, both Chairpersons acknowledge the need to address the underlying socio-economic challenges as a means of rooting out the problem. “What is essential is ensuring a return to rule of law and heightened efforts to rid the area of firearms, many of which are illegal. We will engage with the Minister of Police on the mechanics of the deployment, but generally we welcome the move,” Ms Joemat-Pettersson said. "Now that the President has moved swiftly, we expect him to inform Parliament of this deployment in terms Section 201 (4) of the Constitution with regards to the reasons, place, number of soldiers as well as the period of employment.” Mr Xaba said.
