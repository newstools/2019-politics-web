#Matric2018: Department should urgently review Business Studies results 15 January 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) calls on the Department of Basic Education (DBE) to urgently review the marking of the National Senior Certificate (NSC) 2018 Business Studies exam. School principals and teachers across the country are reporting a serious problem, where the marks achieved by learners in November were sometimes half of what was achieved during the year. The Business Studies assessments and marks are moderated externally each term and is signed off by the Subject Advisor.  The final School Based Assessment (SBA) marks were also signed off by the Subject Advisor. It is inconceivable that these marks should suddenly drop so dramatically in the final exam and speaks to a systemic error. So far, our queries have only resulted in vague commitments from the Department to ‘look into it’, and suggesting the schools ask for a remark. But waiting for a remark has a direct and serious impact on the future of learners, who will now miss university and college registration and have to wait for remarking. Possible sources of the problem include markers being employed who did not meet the requisite qualification standard or experience, and conversion of the marks during the data capture process. This is why the DBE must urgently investigate rather than just suggest a remark. It is shocking that the government should celebrate the national pass rate while failing these hardworking learners at the same time. Their loss of further education could have serious consequences on matriculants entering the jobs market which is a direct fault of the ANC. As long as the failing ANC remains in government, learners’ futures will continue to be sacrificed so that the DBE can look good no matter the cost.
