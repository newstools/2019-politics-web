According to the report a target of nine designs had to be completed but only two road designs were completed. The following road designs were not completed: PW15- Eastern Corridoreval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0'])); K170- N1 and Golden Highway: Access to Evaton and Sebokeng K11- Construction of Randfontein bypass Mogale City to Western area from K198 to Mohlakeng K16- Between Waltloo and Mamelodieval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0'])); K105- Upgrading of dual carriageway from K60 Tembisa to Kempton Park K122- Klip Valley Road to Vereeniging K60- Tembisa to Kempton Parkeval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0'])); Some of the reasons given for the targets not being met include consultants not adhering to timelines and poor contractor performance. This shows that the department lacks the necessary project management skills to manage such infrastructure projects. These delays are hindering the department from completing critical road infrastructure that is needed to keep our roads in a good condition and motorists safe. The DA will be tabling questions in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature to ascertain what measures are being put in place to ensure that these road designs are completed.
