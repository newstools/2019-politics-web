Confession by ANC NEC Member Hanekom 24 July 2019 The African National Congress is dismayed by its National Executive Committee Member Derek Hanekom’s confession that he did have several meetings with the opposition EFF to indicate that he and other ANC MPs would support the EFF vote of no confidence last February against Former President Jacob Zuma. Hanekom had full access to air his acerbic views in the NEC of the ANC, he did so ad nauseum. He always spoke in an even, practiced voice, linking all the bad publicity that the ANC has had to the accusations against former President Zuma. The ANC called for an open vote and it is Hanekom and others who put pressure on the Speaker to accede to the demand by the EFF for a secret ballot. The agenda of the EFF, by their own admission as an opposition party, is to displace the ANC; they work fearlessly to divide the ANC and have a number of sleepers in the ANC proactively ensuring that divisions in the ANC are deepened. The ANC is working to unite its members and in our midst is Derek Hanekom, a wedge driver and on a mission to divide the ANC. Indeed this charlatan is making his mark through his ownership of the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation. Hanekom does not have the capacity to form a new political party, but he has shown remarkable agility in his efforts to divide the ANC. Well, we say to him and other EFF sleepers in the ANC, this only makes the members of the NEC, PEC, REC and branches more determined to unite the ANC and deliver services to the people of South Africa. We will ride this storm of accusations and counter accusations. We will unite behind the leadership of President Ramaphosa and all ANC members of good faith and defeat the nefarious negative actions of Hanekom.
