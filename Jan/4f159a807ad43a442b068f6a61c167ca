#Bosasagate: Ramaphosa should suspend Mokonyane with immediate effect 22 January 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) calls on President Cyril Ramaphosa to suspend Environmental Affairs Minister, Nomvula Mokonyane, with immediate effect following the damning allegations levelled against her at the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Capture this past week. In his testimony, former Bosasa COO, Angelo Agrizzi, revealed under oath that over a span of several years Minister Mokonyane allegedly received an amount totalling to R50 000, on a monthly basis from the company. He also revealed that Mokonyane received a list of gifts which included 8 lambs, 12 cases of frozen chicken, 4 cases of spirits and various premium brand brandies, at the end of each year. Clearly Mokonyane is a Minister compromised and cannot be trusted to serve in the best interest of the people. Mokonyane undoubtedly played a central role in aiding and abetting the capture of our state. The president must do the right things and suspend her without any delay as she must be held accountable for her actions. Now is not the time for internal party politics, Ramaphosa either has a choice to allow State Capture to fester, or to suspend a highly compromised individual from his Cabinet and set an example. The DA will however not waiver in our commitment to ensure that all those who have been implicated in corruption are investigated and brought to book. It is for this reason I will be laying criminal charges against Minister Mokonyane at the Parkview Police Station tomorrow. Under a DA national government, corruption will be met with the fullest might of the law. Any person found guilty of fraud and corruption will be sentenced to 15 years imprisonment.
