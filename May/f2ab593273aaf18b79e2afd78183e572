German Parliament rules BDS movement is antisemitic 20 May 2019 The South African Zionist Federation applauds the German Parliament's ruling that the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement (BDS) is antisemitic.  This unequivocal message from the Bundestag carries significant weight, given Germany's dark understanding of the meaning and consequences of antisemitism. We call upon the ANC, whose foreign policy and position towards the Jewish State is dictated by the BDS movement, to grasp the consequences of their alignment with an antisemitic fringe organisation. The latest outcome of this unholy ANC-BDS alliance is the affirmation by the Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Lindiwe Sisulu, of the downgrade of the South African Embassy in Israel. We reject the disingenuous arguments by the Minister’s advisor that many Jews ensorse the antisemitic BDS movement and the downgrade of diplomatic relations between Israel and South Africa. The radical far-left organisation SAJFP who take this position represent no-one but themselves and are supported by a fraction of one percent of the entire Jewish population in South Africa. The overwhelming majority of Jews in South Africa are vociferously opposed to the ANC’s unique discrimination and sanction of the one and only Jewish State amongst all the countries of the world. The German Parliament stated that BDS campaigns are a modern echo of “the most terrible chapter in German history” and are reminiscent of Nazi campaigns against Jews. The SAZF calls on the ANC to consider the consequences, whether intended or not, of their alliances and actions and where they may lead. Issued by Ben Swartz, National Chairman, SAZF, 20 May 2019
