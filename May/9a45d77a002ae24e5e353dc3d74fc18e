Man arrested for farm attack in Limpopo 29 May 2019 An joint operation by various police units has led to the arrest of a man wanted for a farm attack in Makhado, Limpopo. Police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the 29-year-old man had been on the run following an incident, where he and four other suspects allegedly attacked a family on their farm. Police are still searching for the other four. "An intelligence-led joint operation comprised of the Makhado K9 Unit, Crime Intelligence and Detectives, led to a major breakthrough in arresting a 29-year-old suspect at Tshikota location, outside Makhado, on Monday. The arrest emanates from a house robbery which occurred during a farm attack incident outside Makhado along the Vivo Road. "It is alleged that on Monday, at about 10:30, an 81-year-old woman and her 61-year-old son, were attacked by five unknown armed suspects at their farm. During this incident, the suspects robbed the victims of various items, including a handbag with cash... and an air rifle, before fleeing the scene. Both victims sustained injuries and were taken to hospital for medical treatment," said Ngoepe. Police were notified about the incident and responded quickly, he said. "Tracks of the suspects were followed until one of them was arrested. The other suspects are still on the run, but a manhunt is still underway. The suspect will appear before the Louis Trichardt Magistrate's Court soon on charges of house robbery and two counts of attempted murder," he said. Last week, in another farm attack incident, a 40-year-old man was arrested in Limpopo for allegedly killing activist Annette Kennealy on her farm near Makhado. The suspect was employed by Kennealy. Kennealy had been outspoken about farm murders. Her last few Facebook posts highlighted the issue. On May 19, she posted a link claiming that 10 farm attacks, including one murder, had been reported in four days. News24
