SAPS inefficiency lets Baby G’s abuser off the hook 20 August 2019 The DA Women’s Network is shocked and disappointed by the Verulam Magistrate’s Court decision, made yesterday, to strike off the roll the case of a Phoenix mother who was caught on video allegedly abusing her 4-year-old daughter. This unfortunate miscarriage of justice for the young victim came about because SAPS, as is often the case, bungled the evidence and failed to produce it in court. The court states that the case had to be struck off the roll because video footage from the accused's cellphone was still outstanding due to SAPS’s cyber crime unit in Pretoria failing to provide the required evidence. This is simply unacceptable and yet another case where victims and defenceless in our society are revictimized due to SAPS inefficiency. It is our considered view that crimes involving children should not only be a priority crime written into legislation, but the criminal justice system, including the police, must take active steps to showcase their ability and commitment to solving such crimes. In 2018, SAPS reported that there were over 200 murder cases involving children in KZN alone and in crimes committed against children, murder was up 17,4% with 985 killed, nationally. Baby G could have been part of these statistics and this matter provides SAPS with the greatest opportunity to send a strong message to those abusing children that this will not be tolerated any more. The DA Women’s Network will continue to monitor this case and will do everything at our disposal to ensure that justice is finally served for the 4-year-old and many others like her. The justice system continues to let down the most vulnerable in our society. The DA is fully committed to a country where women and children can live freely and feel safe in all corners of the country, we are working hard to make sure that this dream becomes a reality.
