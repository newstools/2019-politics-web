DA calls on IEC to urgently respond to letters of complaint 11 April 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes the decision by the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC)to investigate the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) for alleged contraventions of the Electoral Code of Conduct. We are however concerned that the IEC has not confirmed whether they will be investigating Black Land First (BLF) for the same allegations. On 20 March and 02 April 2019, the Democratic Alliance (DA) laid complaints with the IEC against the EFF and BBLF for breaching the Electoral Code of Conduct as contained in the Electoral Act 73 of 1998. In the crucial run up to the 08 May National and Provincial Elections, which should be a time of robust but clean policy position debate, the EFF and BLF have used language which not only provokes outlandish violence but which also incites fear and hatred against minorities. This incitement includes EFF leader Julius Malema indicating that he cannot guarantee that a white genocide will not occur in the future. Part of the DA’s complaint also includes Julius Malema firing a rifle at a political rally as well as ANC supporters firing off random shots from a handgun on top of a moving municipal fire truck in eMzinoni, Mpumalanga. The DA complaints against the BLF include: - BLF indicating that their party “don’t accept white people” - BLF members singing that members of the white population be killed - BLF Leader, Andile Mngxitama threatening to send all white people to hell Sections 9(1)(a)(i) and 9(2) of the Electoral Code of Conduct, Electoral Act 73 of 1998 outline what is considered prohibited conduct during an election, including “using language which provokes violence” and “carrying arms or weapons at political meetings, marches or rallies”, respectively. The DA is the only party in South Africa truly committed to building One South Africa for All in line with the founding values of our constitutional democracy and we will continue to insist that hate speech is dealt with in accordance with the law.
