DA condemns alleged rape of girls by ANC Sol Plaatje councillor 13 February 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Northern Cape welcomes the arrest of an ANC councillor in Kimberley, who stands accused of raping a minor with mental illness and attempting to rape her friend, while allegedly keeping them prisoner in his house in Lerato Park over the weekend. It is reprehensible that a man, who has been voted into a leadership position by residents of the community, is implicated in such vile and criminal acts against the very girl children whom he is meant to protect. The DA strongly condemns any form of violence against women and children and we are calling on the ANC to immediately remove the councillor from any position of power until the matter is finalised in a court of law. Given that the safety of children is at stake, the councillor must, for the time being, be viewed as a threat to young girls and he should not be trusted to lead his community. The DA firmly believes that there is no place, other than jail, for rapists. Only change under a DA-led government will ensure that those who abuse positions of power in order to take advantage of vulnerable girls and women, must be dealt with as harshly as possible.
