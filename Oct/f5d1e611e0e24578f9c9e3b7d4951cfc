DA to keep an eagle’s eye on SABC bailout 4 October 2019 The DA notes with extreme caution the R3.2 billion bailout the ANC government will be giving to the SABC, R2.1 billion of which the public broadcaster will receive on Monday.eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0'])); The DA will be closely monitoring how this money is spent, and if any even the slightest financial mismanagement or any other malfeasance is detected, immediate action will be taken against the SABC. The DA fully is aware the complexities in the matter. The current SABC management and board cannot be blamed for the financial crisis the SABC has faced for the past two years, as it is a legacy of the Hlaudi Motsoeneng tenure. This does not mean that they will be left off the hook, particularly as per Communications Minister, Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams’ revelation today that the SABC only met five of the conditions Treasury prescribed, whilst partially meeting two and failing to meet one of these conditions. The conditions which were only partially or not at all met, include: Producing separate financial reporting for public and commercial broadcasting services, Identifying non-core assets for saleeval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',114,'0','0'])); Develop a comprehensive private sector participation strategy. In terms of the conditions which have met the DA will request a briefing from both Minister Ndabeni-Abrahams and the SABC. We are aware of the acrimonious relationship that has existed between both, and to get the full facts, the DA would like to hear the story from both sides. The DA maintains that bailouts are but a temporary solution to challenges which requires political will, good corporate governance and executives who are beyond reproach.eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_5',115,'0','0'])); We will be keeping an eagle’s eye on the matter.
