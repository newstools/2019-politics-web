SANEF Deeply Concerned By Allegations Of Editorial Interference In The Newsroom At eNCA The South African National Editors’ Forum (SANEF) is deeply concerned on 19 December 2019, by allegations from former senior eNCA journalist, Samkele Maseko that eNCA’s Kanthan Pillay had censored stories in the newsroom. The censoring of journalists, who report in ethical and responsible ways is anathema in our industry and should always be strongly condemned. Media freedom is a critical part of a healthy and functional democracy and should be fiercely protected by all South Africans.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0'])); SANEF will, therefore, write to eNCA management to request a meeting and to seek clarity on Mr. Pillay’s position. The allegations of censorship against a senior editorial executive at eNCA go against the principles that SANEF holds dear. SANEF, therefore, calls on eNCA to immediately get to the bottom of these allegations against Pillay. We welcome the fact that Maseko has agreed to approach Judge Kathleen Satchwell and the Media Ethics and Credibility Inquiry to discuss these issues further.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0'])); SANEF calls on all editors, media owners and newsroom executives to guard against all instances of editorial interference in newsrooms and to allow journalists to continue with their work in a responsible and ethical manner.
