In 2018 Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Hospital admitted 43 529 patients, whilst Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital admitted 104 495 patients. Due to various reasons, such as a high number of acute and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds, patient related issues, infrastructure and equipment related issues; both hospitals had to cancelled or deferred planned theatre procedures. For 2018 the CMAH cancelled 2036 whereas the CHBAH deferred 1979 procedures. These procedures are then rescheduled at the earliest suitable time taking into consideration factors that led to deferment. It should be noted that facilities have put systems in place to improve patient outcomes including active participation of patients in scheduling of operations by introducing electronic communication system for booking, reminder and cancellation. Evaluation of patients for major elective surgical procedures at preanesthetic clinic before booking is made. Patients scheduled for elective surgical procedures to be in hospital on time (7pm) to ensure uninterrupted supply of consumables for elective surgical procedures and cutting time for elective surgical procedures across to be at 8pm. Other measures being put in place to ensure that fewer procedures are cancelled or deferred include strengthening the cluster system and outreach, performing some of the operations in the cluster hospitals, extending arthroplasty list to 7pm during the week. Improving patient outcomes and patient experience in Gauteng health facilities remains a top priority of the 6th Administration.
