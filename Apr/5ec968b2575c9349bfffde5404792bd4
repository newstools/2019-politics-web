Malema’s reckless shooting incident imitated country wide 3 April 2019 After Julius Malema fired an object which looked like an assault rifle at the EFF’s five-year anniversary last year, AfriForum’s warning fell on deaf ears that such reckless behaviour may create a dangerous precedent if the SAPS and the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) did not prosecute him immediately. The tendency to fire weapons into the air took root – despite other peoples’ safety. In the middle of March 2019, the owner of a security firm – with links to the local municipality in Dundee, KwaZulu-Natal – and his accomplices fired various shots with objects that look like firearms. The incident happened in a residential area. In another incident on 20 March 2019 in Emzinoni close to Bethal, Mpumalanga, a person in an MK Veteran’s uniform fired an object that looks like a hand weapon. He was on the back of a truck that belongs to the Govan Mbeki Municipality. It happened in front of various members of the Mpumalanga Traffic Police – in a residential area – and without taking into consideration the safety of people living in the vicinity. Various people fired several shots with several firearms in Bedfordview on 27 March 2019 – in full view of the Johannesburg Metro Police. The authorities confirmed that they are busy collecting evidence to investigate the incident. AfriForum closely monitors the investigation. AfriForum brought criminal charges against Malema shortly after the EFF’s festivities. The dossier currently serves before the NPA to ensure that it is complete and ready for the hearing. AfriForum receives feedback in this regard on a regular basis. AfriForum also acted after the other incidents. The security firm owner was reported to the Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority (PSiRA) and AfriForum keeps a firm eye on the investigation. The matter of the alleged MK veteran’s actions in Emzinoni was referred to the Director General of Community Safety, Security and Liaison of the Mpumalanga Provincial Government. The latter, as well as the Emzinoni Police Office alleged that they had no knowledge of the matter and AfriForum provided them with all the information. They undertook to attend to the matter and investigate it. AfriForum will regularly follow up to ensure that they keep to their undertaking. “Malema set a very troublesome example through his reckless actions. His actions, now being imitated across the country, threaten public safety and undermine current firearm legislation,” says Marnus Kamfer, AfriForum’s Legal and Risk Manager for Community Safety. “The fact that politicians, who are also electoral candidates and serve in Parliament, set these bad examples, resulting in an upsurge of similar actions, points to the seriousness of the matter. AfriForum attends to it with the urgency that it deserves,” says Ian Cameron, AfriForum’s Head of Community Safety. AfriForum will immediately attend to any similar incidents that may present itself in a bid to stop the current tendency in its tracks.
