#ScrapETollsNow: Gauteng Voters need clarity on e-Toll debt and summonses 29 March 2019 The Democratic Alliance in Gauteng (DA) is demanding clarity from government on exactly what will happen to the e-Tolling system in Gauteng. Yesterday the Minister of Finance, Tito Mboweni slammed the South African National Roads Agency’s (Sanral) decision to suspend the process of pursuing e-Toll debt. The ANC is not consistent when it comes to e-Tolls. On the one hand, the ANC in Gauteng says e-Tolls must go, but national government says the prosecution of those who owe e-Toll fees must go ahead. Who is fooling who? If the government was serious about getting rid of e-Toll debt, Minister Mboweni would cut government overspending in order to fund e-Tolls and the number of Cabinet Ministers as well as VIP Protection for them. Questions need to be asked about the fuel and car licence renewal levies that are paid by motorists. Where is this money going? The already overburdened residents of Gauteng are being mocked by the Minister of Finance. It is clear that the ANC is using e-Tolls as an electioneering tool. The people of Gauteng must not be surprised when the suspension of pursuing e-Toll debts is lifted after the 8th of May The DA will continue to put pressure on government to get rid of e-Tolls.
