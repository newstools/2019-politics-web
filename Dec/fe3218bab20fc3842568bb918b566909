SADTU warns Mashaba to stop using the union’s name to gain traction 10 December 2019 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0']));The South African Democratic Teachers’ Union (SADTU), the largest union in the education and public service sectors cannot allow former DA member and Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba to denigrate SADTU using his former master’s tactics. Mashaba’s latest statement on the launch of his so-called “People's Dialogue” is a clear indication that he is either suffering from the DA hangover or is still dancing to his master’s tune. He claims he received thousands of submissions from people “who are desperate to engage in a conversation about how we can build a South Africa that works for all.” eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));And yet, out of all those “thousands” of submissions, Mashaba has seen it fit to single out a submission that is calling for the restriction of SADTU. "Yet another citizen called for the government to 'restrict Sadtu as they are protecting unqualified and incompetent teachers'," reads the statement The quote is a replica of the DA’s trite propaganda and parrot Mashaba has replicated it under the cloak “citizen submission”. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));The DA has used every trick to discredit the largest union in the education and public service sectors. However, judging by the continuous growth of SADTU membership, their attempts have failed. Mashaba, as a black African, should hang his head in shame for mimicking his masters failed tricks. The conditions our members work under in township and rural school are well known and yet many, on a daily basis, confront and overcome them. The matric results for the past three years continue to vindicate SADTU as they have shown increased quality passes in no-fee or Quintile 1 to 3 schools where most of members teach. It is nauseating that Mashaba a product of inferior Bantu education who managed to overcome the odds and built his empire can call SADTU members unqualified and incompetent. Our members fully understand the low base they come from and have grabbed every opportunity available to improve and overcome the barriers imposed on them by the system. Overcoming those barriers is not Mashaba’s prerogative. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_5',115,'0','0']));SADTU is there to ensure that teachers overcome the barriers imposed by the system so that they can deliver public quality education for all. Our right to exist is enshrined in the Constitution; we don’t need to be restricted. Mashaba, you took your chances with the DA and they backfired. Go back to what you know best - fiddle with people’s hair. Issued by Nomusa Cembi, Media Officer, SADTU, 10 December 2019
