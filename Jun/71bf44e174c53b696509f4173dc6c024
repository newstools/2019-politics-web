Multichoice retrenchment update 30 June 2019 The first meeting which was supposed to be the “first consulting” with the Unions according to Multichoice was found to be grossly irregular according to Sec189 and its subsequent sections under sec189 of Labour Relation Act. The Unions have resoundingly criticized the process leading to the meeting for the following reasons: 1. The letter was devoid of any legal compliance according to Sec189 2. The letter was wholly misleading in that Multichoice said CCMA Commissioner will facilitate the proceedings only to realize that the Commissioner was hired as a private facilitator without consent of Unions. 3. The letter to Unions was not standard, without signature nor dated. 4. The Multichoice is engaging in parallel process whereby employees have already been given Voluntary Severance Package prior to consulting Unions and want to consult the Unions after the affect. In conclusion, the Unions have made compelling submission of the process to be withdrawn wholly, Voluntary, Severance Package letters to unconditionally withdrawn and should Multichoice wish to proceed, it should first consult with Unions. Finally, the Unions were successful in stopping the process for now. Issued by Thabang Mothelo, ICTU Media Officer, 30 June 2019
