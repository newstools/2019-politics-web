Joburg back in the hands of failing ANC 5 December 2019 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) notes the election of the ANC's Geoff Makhubo as the Executive Mayor of the City of Johannesburg as a sad event for the people of Johannesburg. It is a tragic situation which mirrors the day Nelson Mandela Bay was taken away from a Coalition for Change by a Coalition of Corruption. Makhubo's appointment marks the regression of three difficult but proud years for the people of Johannesburg and a City that was passionately led by the DA, ACDP, IFP, Cope and FF+. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));As with the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality,  we can now expect to see all the good work by the DA-led administration being undone. In the last three years since the DA took over the administration of the City of Johannesburg from the ANC in 2016 we have improved the running of the City in the following ways: We leave the City in a better financial position than we inherited three years ago eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2',114,'0','0']));We increased revenue levels from R35.29 billion in 2017/18 to surpass the R40 billion collection mark for the first time in 2018/19 We facilitated external investment in the City from R4.5 billion to R17.3 billion, bringing thousands of job opportunities to residents We advanced our programme of Diphethogo in order to bring meaningful transformation to the lives of our 5 million residents eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0']));We delivered 9000 more title deeds to home owners than any other administration in the City’s history We reversed years of corrupt outsourcing practices by employing thousands of cleaners and security guards on permanent contracts We introduced opportunity centres to assist our youth in gaining skills and finding employment We created 55 635 Expanded Public Works Programme (EPWP) job opportunities, giving residents a foot up the ladder of employment We delivered 6261 housing opportunities for residents We introduced mobile clinics, and extended operating hours at clinics and libraries We initiated Operation BuyaMthetho and put more metro police officers out on the streets to curb lawlessness and reduce crime Although this is a loss and a setback, the DA will not give up the fight against corruption. We will not give up the fight to ensure the people's money is spent appropriately on service delivery. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-large-leaderboard-2','ezslot_3',117,'0','0']));The DA remains committed to building one SA for all.
