Critical to ensuring timeous payment is the implementation of systems that track invoices sufficiently, and reporting mechanisms to track late payments. In 2013, a survey conducted by Provincial Treasury revealed that not all Western Cape Government departments had a suitable system in place to track invoices.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',114,'0','0'])); This led to Provincial Treasury issuing a circular requiring all Accounting Officers to track the receipt of invoices, progress made with the payments of these invoices and when it was settled, as well as the reasons for the delay of payments. Provincial Treasury also implemented stringent monthly reporting processes to report on invoice payments. In cases where invoices are settled after 30 days, departments are required to provide reasons for the late payments, together with the age analysis and the remedial or preventative measures that have been instituted to remedy such cases in future. Where invoices have not been paid on time it could be attributed to outstanding verification processes that delay payments to contractors or instances where invoices are issued to regional office s and need to be re-routed. Minister for Finance and Economic Opportunities, Minister David Maynier, reinforced the Western Cape Government’s commitment to paying suppliers timeously: “For businesses to thrive they need predictable cash flow to pay their employees, deliver services or products, and continue contributing to our economy and creating more jobs. ‘It would simply be wrong if government was responsible for the closure of a business due to the late payment of invoices, as this would contribute to job losses and an increased unemployment rate in the Western Cape. “A thriving private sector is critical to the growth of the economy in the Western Cape.  As the Western Cape Government, we are “open for business” and committed to working with businesses in the province to grow the economy and create jobs in the Western Cape.” Statement issued by Francine Higham, Spokesperson for the Provincial Minister of Finance and Economic Opportunities (Responsible for the Provincial Treasury and the Department of Economic Development and Tourism), 11 October 2019eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-banner-1','ezslot_5',116,'0','0']));
