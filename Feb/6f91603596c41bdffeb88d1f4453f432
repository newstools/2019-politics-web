SADTU saddened by the loss of three learners at Driehoek Hoërskool 1 February 2019 The union has learned with shock the accidental death of three and the injury of twenty three learners at Hoerskool Driehoek in Vanderbijlpark following the collapse of a pathway immediately after the school assembly this morning. This is indeed a sad moment. We applaud the GDE, through the MEC Panyaza Lesufi, Gauteng government structures, private agencies and individuals for the swift response to this unfortunate occurrence. We commend the deployment of professional trauma counselling to the entire school population. The temporary closure of the school shall give space for the performance of this huge difficult task.  An intensive professional investigation into the circumstances surrounding the occurrence of this disaster must be instituted so that appropriate measures can be taken to avoid the recurrence of this painful situation. We send our heartfelt condolences to the family of the departed and wish the injured speedy recovery. Issued by Tseliso Ledimo, Provincial Secretary, SADTU Gauteng, 1 February 2019
