Hundreds of beds rust outside at Bara Hospital 5 May 2019 I am disturbed by a widely-circulated video that shows hundreds of steel beds at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital stored outside at the mercy of sun and rain. Many of them look in good condition, but will deteriorate rapidly in unsheltered conditions. The video was taken last week on Wednesday by a man who was visiting his son in the paediatric ward. This is a clear waste of state assets as these beds should be put to good use instead of rusting outside. There are hospitals that are short of beds where they could be used or they could be donated to non-profit institutions. Despite failing to fix healthcare in Gauteng for five years, Premier David Makhura said yesterday that it was a “serious weakness” that would be addressed if the ANC was re-elected. Only the DA has the political will and commitment to eradicate corruption and inefficiency to ensure hospitals and clinics provide quality care.
