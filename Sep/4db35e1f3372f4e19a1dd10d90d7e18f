FF Plus will conduct an internal investigation into the allegation that one of its members used the k-word 25 September 2019 The FF Plus was informed today of a complaint that the DA wants to lodge with the police against one of the party's members for allegedly using the k-word. The incident reportedly took place about five years ago when the member in question, Ms Marcelle Maritz, was still a DA councillor. Ms Maritz denies having used the word and, therefore, the leadership of the FF Plus will conduct an internal investigation into the matter to get to the truth. The FF Plus is strongly opposed to any form of racism from any side of society and will take strict action if need be. Issued by Wouter Wessels,Â FF Plus spokesperson, 25 September 2019 We will tomorrow lay criminal charges against Limpopo @VFPlus Leader and Member of the Provincial Legislature, Marcelle Maritz, for using the K-word when referring to the APK Church as the "Church without K*****".There is no place for racists in our society. pic.twitter.com/UTaadTjR4n
