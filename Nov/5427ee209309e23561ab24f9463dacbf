ANC endorses motion highlighting DA’s good governance record In a surprise admission on Tuesday in the National Council of Provinces (NCOP), the ANC agreed to a Democratic Alliance (DA) motion concerning unemployment in Mpumalanga and further acknowledged the DA’s good governance capabilities in the Western Cape. The motion read that the Council: "Recognises that by the end of 2018, the Western Cape’s expanded unemployment rate was 23.1%, 14 points below the national average, with 29 000 new jobs created last year, demonstrating the province’s ability and will to govern well." This is not the first time the ANC has recognized the DA’s good governance record in the NCOP. Two weeks ago, in a separate motion the DA brought before the House, concerning the Lydenburg Dam in Mpumalanga and the looming water crises faced by the Thaba Chweu Local Municipality, the ANC also agreed to the motion that included a final paragraph recognizing the DA’s capability of governing better than the ANC: “Acknowledge that only under a DA government, would all necessary steps have been taken and residents would have been informed of restrictions to ensure that no one is left without water.” The ANC is finally realising and publicly admitting to the DA’s good governance record, especially in municipalities. In the spirit of co-operative governance, we call on the ANC across all provinces to engage with DA governments in order to learn on how to provide effective and quality service delivery, so that South Africans living under ANC governance can experience and enjoy political leadership that creates access to jobs and opportunities, and basic service delivery like the residents of the Western Cape, Kouga, Johannesburg, Midvaal and Tshwane experience every day.
