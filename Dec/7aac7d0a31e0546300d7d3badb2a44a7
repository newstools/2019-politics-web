DA welcomes arrest of alleged SASSA fraudsters, calls for more future arrests 11 December 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes the arrest of four women in KwaZulu-Natal in connection to fraud involving the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA). Three of the women are purportedly government employees whilst the fourth is alleged to be an insurance consultant. The women stand accused of defrauding SASSA of an estimated R900 000 through fictitious and dead beneficiaries. This sort of criminality has become all too common in the social grants system, and the DA is of the view that there are still countless similar cases all around the country which are yet to be exposed. We therefore welcome these arrests and implore upon SASSA, the Department of Social Development and law enforcement agencies to continue exposing the criminals in the social grants system and hold them to account to the fullest extent of the law. This kind of fraud and corruption is utterly appalling, as it not only defrauds the state, but it defrauds the poor and vulnerable.
