Forest Hill High: DA calls on Lesufi to act fast on school safety 3 June 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) is shocked that there has been yet another incidence of violence at a school in Turffontein. This is not the first time that there have been incidents of violence at our schools. As the DA we convey our condolences to the family and friends of the deceased learners. The necessary counseling must be provided to the community. Earlier this year a pupil at Mondeor High School was stabbed to death while on his way to school. School safety must be prioritised and the department needs to liaise with the Department of Community Safety to ensure that there are vetted school patrollers at every school to ensure the safety of pupils and teachers. The violence taking place at the province's and country's schools calls for outcomes based action. We had previously called for a provincial inquiry into school safety and this was rejected. How many more young lives must be list before this matter is taken seriously? Schools need to be a safe haven, where there is a conducive environment for teaching and learning. The DA will closely monitor the progress of the investigation and those who are found guilty must face the full might of the law. Issued by Khume Ramulifho, DA Shadow MEC for Education, 3 June 2019
