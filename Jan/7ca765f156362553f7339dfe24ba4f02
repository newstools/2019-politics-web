DA mourns the death of liberal stalwart, Rupert Lorimer The Democratic Alliance (DA) is deeply saddened by the passing of the great liberal stalwart, Rupert Lorimer. We send our heartfelt condolences to Lorimer’s family and loved ones during these difficult times. Lorimer was elected as a Member of Parliament for the Progressive Party in 1974 and joined Helen Suzman in Parliament in the fight against the brutal apartheid regime. Along with his liberal counterparts, Lorimer never shied away from speaking truth to power during South Africa’s darkest days. He devoted his life to fighting for freedom and opportunity for all South Africans. Lorimer’s courage and passion will not be forgotten, and the DA will continue to fight for his enduring legacy.
