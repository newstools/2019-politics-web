Resounding victory for the Democratic Alliance Student Organisations at University of Pretoria 29 August 2019 DASO has been given a renewed majority mandate to lead the Student Representative Council at the University of Pretoria. DASO members launched the “Lalela Campaign” in July 2018 working towards the 2019 election. The purpose of the campaign was to listen intensely to the student populous, and to address the issues raised in Student Council and in the local DA Government. DASO believes that successful campus governance can only be realised if different spheres of governments collaborate. With the assistance of the Tshwane DA-led Government we were able to address various student issues, where one such issue was the creation of the Tshwane Bike Unit which patrols frequented areas of students. Our good cooperative governance programme will now continue under our newly election representatives, with our majority seat allocations as: DASO - 6 EFFSC - 3 SASCO - 2 Independent - 1 Our DASO candidates remain committed to the students of Tuks, and to implementing DA policy created around students.
