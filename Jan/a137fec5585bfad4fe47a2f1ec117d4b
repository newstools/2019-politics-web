Failing ANC's mismanagement means Gauteng junior doctors must wait a month to be paid 30 January 2019 Junior doctors doing their internship and community service in Gauteng hospitals won’t be paid at the end of this month but will have to wait until the end of February for their first paycheck this year. At the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Hospital, the newly employed doctors were informed as follows: “Kindly note that your salary will not be paid on 31 January 2019 due to the late creation of posts at Central Office. The posts were created 22 January 2019 in the afternoon. The mandates were prepared on 23 January 2019 and was sent by courier the morning of 24 January 2019 to e-Government for processing. Unfortunately, it was not enough time for e-Govemment to process them before the salary run on 28 January 2019 therefore, your salaries will be paid on/before 28 February 2019.” Click here for the notice. I am appalled that junior doctors will suffer because of the inefficiency of the Gauteng Health Department. It is totally unacceptable that they will have to wait a month to be paid. The Department must make a plan to pay them as soon as possible, rather than give a poor excuse that violates labour law and will cause acute distress to doctors who have to pay their bills like everyone else.
