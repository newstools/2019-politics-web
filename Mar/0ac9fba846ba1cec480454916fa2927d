No corruption: the DA narrative suggesting I am corrupt is proven wrong yet again by our independent agencies of government. 6 March 2019 Yet again, the DA narrative indicating that I am corrupt is proven to be wrong, this time by the South African Auditor-General, Kimi Makwetu. Last year the independent judiciary also similarly pronounced in my favour three times.  In doing so, the courts proved that it was my team, not the DA, fighting to uphold South Africa’s Constitution and the rights to equal justice for all citizens. Last year, the Auditor-General confirmed that documents circulated by DA MPs had been forged and were fake. I am pleased to be vindicated once again. I note with pride in the recent City of Cape Town publication that the Auditor-General’s findings for the 2017/18 financial year confirmed our unqualified audit status and furthermore that the City of Cape Town has confirmed that “all expenditure was fully accounted for and used to deliver services to residents”.
