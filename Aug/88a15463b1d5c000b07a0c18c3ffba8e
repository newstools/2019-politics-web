POPCRU condemns mob attack on police in Johannesburg 2 August 2019 The Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union (POPCRU) condemns the mob attack on police witnessed in Johannesburg on Thursday by an alleged group of foreign national shop owners. Each and every country has got its laws and bylaws accordingly, and in line with the South African Constitution, police are there to maintain law and order. Their role is to uphold these laws, and the role of citizens, whether of local or foreign origin, is to abide by the stipulated laws. We strongly feel that the Thursday activity was coordinated and planned to detail, partly aimed at provoking and portraying police to be brutal and incompetent. We commend our members for their act of withdrawing from what was a clearly volatile situation that could have led to the unfortunate loss of lives or injuries. This was a demonstration of courage and sensibility on their part. We want to categorically caution the African Diaspora Forum’s (ADF) reckless utterances which seek to suggest that the prevention of criminal activity are victimisation. There is only one law for all who live within the boundaries of this country, and this forum should confine itself within the frameworks therein. Instead of insinuating unnecessary divisions, the ADF must be at the centre of promoting obedience to the law of this hosting country. Our members should always defend themselves when attacked, and must never allow lawlessness to take place within our communities, and this must be done within reasonable measures. We call for an engagement between policing stakeholders, government and small business representatives to convene and engage about such matters in avoiding the regrettable eventualities witnessed on Thursday. We further call on our government to speed up dialogue in ensuring there are demarcated trading areas. Issued by Richard Mamabolo, Media and Communications Officer, 2 August 2019
