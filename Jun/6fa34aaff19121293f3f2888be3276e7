N2 Express service still suspended, mechanism underway to refund commuters The City of Cape Town is doing its best to resolve the current impasse that has led to the temporary suspension of the N2 Express service. We are very concerned about the impact the suspended service is having on MyCiTi commuters from Mitchells Plain and Khayelitsha. We want to get the N2 Express buses on the road again as soon as possible.  However, we need to follow due process and must do so in a manner that provides a long-term solution. At this point in time we are dealing with a number of complexities. We do not want to repeat past mistakes. As such, we have initiated a comprehensive investigation into the matter. Time is of the essence, but the City will refrain from making rash decisions as we are pursuing a resolution that will ensure a sustainable solution going forward. I am pleased to say that we have devised a mechanism to allow commuters who have been affected by the suspension of the service to claim for refunds. We will inform commuters once the mechanism is available and ready, so that they can use alternative modes of public transport. Again, I want to sincerely apologise to our commuters who have relied on and supported the N2 Express service since its inception in July 2014. We will let the public know once the service is ready to operate again. For now, the N2 Express service unfortunately remains suspended until further notice.
