Ad Hoc Committee on Section 25 adopts its programme 25 October 2019 The Chairperson of the Ad Hoc Committee to Initiate and Introduce Legislation Amending Section 25 of the Constitution today adopted its draft framework programme on how it will conduct its work. The committee is proposing to hold a two-day workshop, on 6 and 7 November 2019 with experts on the question of land and constitutional matters. Committee Chairperson, Dr Mathole Motshekga said the aim of the workshop is to have a constitutional dialogue on land ownership. He said the committee will consider the invitation of a senior Judge to chair the workshop in order to ensure fairness. The list of experts to present at the workshop is going to be finalised today. According to the draft programme, the committee envisions to present a draft Bill on 27 November 2019 and have several sessions for deliberations by Members of Parliament. The Bill is likely to be published in the Government Gazette on 10 December 2019, after which, a public awareness drive will start. The official call for public comments is expected to come to an end on 27 January 2020. According to the current framework, the committee is expected to have public hearings in February 2020. Dr Motshekga said: “Public participation is a constitutional imperative. We will ensure that there is sufficient public participation. We will put the interests of South Africans first and we want to ensure that all South Africans participate. The committee wants to give everyone an opportunity to give an input, even those who have a different view. We will make sure that the interests of all South Africans are put first as it is not just the interest of a section of the public.” Dr Motshekga said the programme is a framework at this stage, it can be changed as the committee deems fit, and keeping in mind that it intends to finalise the programme at the end of March 2020.
