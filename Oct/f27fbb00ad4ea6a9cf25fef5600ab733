Where the mayor has cited matters related to the governance of the City the IFP will study these, and make a pronouncement in due course. We wish Mayor Herman Mashaba well in his future endeavors, and thank him for his service to the People of Johannesburg.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0'])); The Cooperation Government has not been without its challenges, but importantly most often than not we have been able to agree on the best possible solutions for the People we serve. The disagreements have strengthened our cooperation. During this transition period in the City, the IFP remains committed to putting the People of Johannesburg first; and therefore in the days leading to November 27 service delivery must not be interrupted.
