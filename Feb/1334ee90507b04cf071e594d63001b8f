ANC Western Cape welcomes HRC investigation into Labour Department’s employment policy 13 February 2019 We welcome the commitment by the Human Rights Commission to investigate allegations of discriminatory labour practices by the Department of Labour against coloured people in the Western Cape. This undertaking was given on Monday at a meeting between the Department of Labour, members of Gatvol Capetonians and Mitchells Village Civic Association. Chief Director of Western Cape operations Mawele Ntamo led the Department of Labour’s delegation. The MVCA delegation comprised of its chairperson Sulyman Stellenboom and secretary Lameez Moosa. The meeting, which was chaired by HRC commissioner Reverend Chris Nissen, was held at the urging of the ANC following deep unhappiness expressed over the Department allegedly overlooking coloureds when it filled seven positions in its Mitchell’s Plain office with Africans. The HRC pledged to investigate these allegations, as well as the Department’s employment equity policy, and also to complete it’s probe within 14 working days. ANC Western Cape secretary Faiez Jacobs said: “We welcome this investigation. From what we heard from the Department of Labour, certain designated groups were underrepresented in some the ranks of its employees. We believe in the impartiality and integrity of the HRC report and have the fullest confidence in its investigation.” Issued by Dennis Cruywagen on behalf of ANC Western Cape, 13 February 2019
