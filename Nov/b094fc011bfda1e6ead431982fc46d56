This information was revealed in the department’s annual report for the 2018/2019 financial year. According to the annual report the following tenders were cancelled: Tender Number Description Estimated Value DRT 09/06/2016 Grass cutting, tree felling and litter picking for a period of three years: Five regions in Gauteng Province R201 000 000 DRT 18/10/2016 Construction of road P1-1 (R82) (57) phase 3 from D1073 (Walkerville) to K164 (De Deur) approximately 11.3KM) and road K164 between road D904 and road 905 (Approximately 4.1KM) R800 000 000 DRT 119/02/2017 Constructing of new K73 (1.381) between K58 (Allandale Road) and K71 (Woodmead Drive), upgrading of sections of K58 (2.784KM) and K7 (0.962KM) and rehabilitation of K58 (0.65KM) and rehabilitation of K58 (0.65KM) between Maple drive and K71 R191 000 000 DRT 43/11/2017 The visual assessment of roads, bridges, major culverts and pavement surveillance measurements R30 000 000 DRT 34A/08/2017 Public Transport Operations Grant- 8 bus subsidy contracts R93 000 000 DRT 39/07/2017 Professional Engineering Services for the Preliminary Design Review & Detail Design of PW15 from R21 to N3, approximately 35.4KM & supervision for N3 to N17, approximately 15.5 KM (Phase 1) R6 000 000 DRT 18/07/2017 Construction phase: K175 (R568): Rehabilitation of road K175 (R568) (Tshwane) 12 months R55 000 000 DRT 116/02/2017 Rehabilitation of road P122/1 (R57) from km8.4 to P36/1 (R10) (Solomon Mahlangu Drive) approximately 9.3KM R180 000 000 eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0']));The cancellation of these tenders has a negative impact on mobility as it contributes to increasing traffic congestion and ultimately gridlock. The R1.5 billion should have been spent on construction and the maintenance of road infrastructure could have contributed in offering job opportunities to the unemployed as well as boosting the Gauteng economy. This clearly indicates a lack of consequence management within the supply chain unit of this department. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2',114,'0','0']));It is high time that the department implements stringent measures to discipline officials and companies implicated where the tenders have been cancelled. The DA will table questions in the Gauteng Legislature to the MEC for Roads and Transport, Jacob Mamalobo to determine what consequence management system is in place and whether these tenders will be re-advertised.
