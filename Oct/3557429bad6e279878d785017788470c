In response to this Tweet, MEC Maile wrote, “He’s actually giving the buildings to Jews.  Ask him who are the new owners of these buildings?” The MEC refused to apologise for his utterances claiming that he did nothing wrong and that he stated a fact.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0'])); If the MEC is aware of any irregularities in terms of the project of revamping the Inner-City buildings, he must address it as is his mandate instead of playing a political game. The Jewish Community like any other citizens of this country are allowed to bid for any tender in the City of Joburg. These irresponsible and horrifying utterances by the MEC in the public space constitutes hate speech.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0'])); MEC Maile has violated his oath of office through his offensive and discriminatory utterances that serve to inspire others to commit violence against Jews. The DA calls on the Integrity Commissioner in the GPL to investigate Maile’s actions and make findings. Should he be found guilty, Maile must apologise to the Jewish Community, retract his Tweet as well as face the consequences of his actions.
