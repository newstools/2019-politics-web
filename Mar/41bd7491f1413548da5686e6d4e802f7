VBS: 15 years jail sentence for politicians who steal 4 March 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the North West reiterates its call to keep those responsible for the VBS scandal accountable. While the failing ANC clearly wants to protect the politicians who recklessly made investments on behalf of their respective municipalities, these failed investments have brought basic service delivery in the implicated municipalities to a halt. We again call for the arrest of all officials involved, for the blatant looting of the people’s money. The failing ANC want them to walk away scot-free while millions in the North West suffer due to poor service delivery and corruption. No action has been taken against mayors at the municipalities here, which is an absolute disgrace. There has also been no action taken against the municipal managers or the chief financial officers of the municipalities. We have laid charges against former Premier Supra Mahumapelo in November last year, following strong allegations citing that he abused his position to facilitate the investment of people’s money with VBS bank, worth R314 million, from four municipalities namely, Madibeng, Moretele, Dr. Ruth Segomotsi Mompati, and Mahikeng. The DA has exercised its oversight role diligently. We have played a positive oversight role to prevent mismanagement of funds, such as assisting to unveil the Mediosa and VBS Bank scandals. The DA remains the only party that can save the North West. When we govern the minimum jail sentence for corruption will be 15 years. The North West cannot afford another five years of the failing ANC. They have been given too many second chances, therefore in order to resuscitate the province, we call on the people of the North West to vote for real Change on 8 May 2019 and Build One South Africa for All.
