Red Ants granted conditional permission to trade while suspended 7 July 2019 The Private Security Industry Regulation Authority (PSiRA), which regulates the security industry, has given the Red Ants conditional permission to trade while suspended, pending an investigation into their conduct. Earlier in the week, it emerged that PSiRA had received several complaints of alleged improper conduct during evictions carried out by the Red Ants. SABC News reported that the regulator said it had received complaints from the public regarding the alleged misconduct of the Red Ants during recent evictions in Alexandra and the Ramaphosa informal settlement in Johannesburg. PSiRa spokesperson Siziwe Zama said on Saturday that the Red Ants had since lodged an appeal. In the meantime, they had applied to operate pending the finalisation of the appeal. "This conditional permission implies that, unless exceptional circumstances exist (which will be considered on a case-by-case basis by the authority), the service provider may render any other service, except demolitions and evictions services, pending the finalisation of the appeal process," Zama said. PSiRA CEO Manabela Chauke said they would be guided by the eventual outcomes of the appeal committee, appointed by the Minister of Police, before making a final determination. News24
