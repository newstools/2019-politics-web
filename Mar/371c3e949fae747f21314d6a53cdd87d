DA in Gauteng opens case of intimidation, theft against ANC Youth League 5 March 2019 Today the Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng opened a case of intimidation, theft and vandalism against the ANC Youth League (ANCYL) at the Pretoria West Police Station. This comes after the ANCYL broke into and vandalised several rooms being occupied by members of the Democratic Alliance Student Organisation (DASO) at the Tshwane University of Technology main campus. Books, clothing and electronics were destroyed and the DASO offices were broken into. DASO members were forced to burn DASO t-shirts. See videos here and here. Campus security and the South African Police Service (SAPS) were on the scene but did not do anything to stop the attack on our members. This is unacceptable and once again highlights the need for a professional and honest police service. We cannot have a situation where our students are intimidated by other students simply for belonging to a political party. We will be closely monitoring the progress of this investigation and we will also be providing counselling to the students affected by this incident.
