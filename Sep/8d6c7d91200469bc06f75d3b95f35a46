EFF REJECTS EWN APOLOGY AND DEMANDS CONCOMITANT ACTION Tuesday, 10 September, 2019 The EFF rejects the delayed lukewarm Eye Witness News apology on the insult issued by their journalist, Barry Bateman, against the CIC Julius Malema. Barry Bateman insulted the CIC Malema on camera following the impromptu press conference outside the HAWKS offices in Silverton. The video has since been shared widely on social media. We have long warned that journalists are responsible for the toxic environment that EFF has to operate in, within the media generally. One must simply imagine what would have happened had the EFF responded to Bateman on the scene to his naked provocation. It is obvious that many would blame EFF for being intolerant of the media and suppressing media freedom. It is also obvious that Bateman could swear at the EFF President Julius Malema because South African journalism has allowed, condoned and promoted bias reporters who have descended to the arena. It is now a central feature of major South African publications and broadcasters to descend into the arena, take sides and expect those they act against to fold their arms. The EWN must take concomitant action. Had it been a black journalist who would have insulted a white party leader, he would be under suspension with immediate effect. Bateman Smust be dealt with the same way and not be accorded the white privilege of kid's gloves. Statement issued by the Economic Freedom Fighters, 10 July 2019
