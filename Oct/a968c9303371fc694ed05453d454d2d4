We welcome the Equality Court’s ruling and trust that all those involved will respect this outcome. The DA is very glad that the Magistrate was able to see through the contrived and trumped up nature of the allegations made by a disgruntled former staff member. The costs order made against the complainant is a welcome outcome and we hope it will bring to an end the vexatious and frivolous litigation by the former staff member.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0'])); The DA will not be distracted by those who seek to derail the Democratic Project. Our commitment is the vision of building One South Africa for All, underpinned by our values of Freedom, Fairness, Opportunity and Diversity.
