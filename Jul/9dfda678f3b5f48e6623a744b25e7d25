DA condemns dangerous profiling of “white Afrikaner farmers” 5 July 2019 The DA condemns comments made by ANC Member of the Free State Legislature, Mojalefa Buti, during the SOPA debate today in which he stated that white Afrikaner farmers are racist. I immediately raised a point of order on this inflammatory profiling of white farmers. The comment was not only an insult to our farming community but can potentially lead to an escalation of farm attacks, a reality which both farmers and farmworkers live with on a daily basis. After an initial attempt to obfuscate the issue and claim that Mr Buti’s comments were historical in nature, the Speaker, Zanele Sifuba, had to reconsider and rule that she would consult the Hansard and revert back to the House at the next sitting. Even after this undertaking by the Speaker, Buti proceeded to make derogatory comments about women in the opposition. After two points of order by DA MPL, Karabo Khakhau, on this unparliamentary behavior, Buti was forced to withdraw his comments by the Speaker. Following the Speaker’s report back on Buti’s comments on white Afrikaner farmers, the DA will take the matter further to the rules and orders committee of the Free State Legislature. The DA remains committed to a South Africa that acknowledges the injustices of the past and the building of a one South Africa for all, united in our diversity.
