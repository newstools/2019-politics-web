DA FedEx studies draft Organisational Review Report ahead of FedCo Note to Editors: The Federal Executive is the highest decision-making body of the DA after the Federal Council and Congress. The Democratic Alliance (DA) Federal Executive (FedEx) met at the Party’s Federal Head Office in Cape Town on Friday to deliberate on the single agenda item of the Draft Report of the Organisational Review Panel. The Organisational Review was commissioned at a meeting of the FedEx immediately after the 8 May 2019 General Election. There was extensive engagement by members of FedEx with the Panel and Draft Report ahead of a two-day sitting of the Federal Council (FedCo) on 19 and 20 October 2019. We wish to stress that no decisions were made in relation to status of the Draft Report, as this function lies with the FedCo as the highest decision-making body of the Party between Congresses. We want to warn against the unauthorised dissemination of the Draft Report, which has not been finalised. The unauthorised dissemination of the Draft Report compromises the integrity of the debate and decisions, which are scheduled to take place at the coming FedCo. Given that the Final Report will only be debated and decided on by FedCo, we will not be commenting on the contents of the Draft Report nor will responses be given to questions related to the process followed in compiling it. The DA remains committed to building one party and one prosperous South Africa for all. Statement issued by Solly Malatsi, DA National Spokesperson, 11 October 2019
