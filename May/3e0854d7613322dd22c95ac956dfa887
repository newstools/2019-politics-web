Esidimeni doctor and nurses still free to practice 27 May 2019 I am extremely concerned that there are further delays in revoking the medical licenses of the health professionals implicated in the Life Esidimeni tragedy. Dr Barney Selebano, the former Head of the Gauteng Health Department, was referred to the SA Health Professions Council (HPCSA) in December 2017, but will only appear before a disciplinary committee in September this year. Former Mental Health Director Makgabo Manamela, her deputy Hannah Jacobus, and chairperson of the Gauteng Mental Health Review Board Dumi Masondo have been referred to the SA Nursing Council (SANC). But SANC CEO Sizo Mchunu says there have been delays in acquiring supporting documents in order to charge them. Both the HPCSA and the SANC can revoke a health workers’ right to practice if they are found guilty of misconduct. The delays are unacceptable. How can those who are implicated in the deaths of patients still be professionally registered to practice medicine? Meanwhile, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) is still probing 45 criminal cases related to the Life Esidimeni tragedy, despite saying previously that this would be concluded by August last year. All investigations must be concluded urgently so that the victims and families of the 144 people who died get the justice they so rightly deserve.
