Unfortunately, our resources are seen by some as an opportunity to feed their criminal deeds and rob our learners of their right to quality basic education. Though, there is support from the law enforcement agencies, the Department is of the belief that more can still be done, and the law enforcement agencies must bring education at the centre of their security analysis, security and risk. This will allow the Department to focus on its main mandate. “We would like to appeal to members of the community to take ownership of their schools and declare war against criminals who are targeting schools. Learners must always focus on their education and avoid ill-discipline,” Lesufi concluded. Issued by Steve Mabona, Gauteng Department of Education Spokesperson, 14 August 2019
