SA’s oil reserves safe for now 28 June 2019 The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) is pleased to see that the Central Energy Fund (CEF) and Glencore have agreed not to proceed with their case, which was due to take place at the Cape High court today. CEF filed an affidavit earlier this week which halted the process that could have influenced the case regarding the illegal sale of SA’s oil reserves. Glencore - one of companies that bought the oil reserves - had brought an application earlier this year that could lead to crucial reports which could possibly influence the court’s decision, being excluded. Ahead of today’s court appearance, OUTA wrote to the Minister of Mineral Resources requesting his intervention. Whilst OUTA has not received any formal correspondence from the Ministry we believe that our call to the Minister has had an impact on this outcome. OUTA thanks all of its supporters as well as the media for applying pressure and bringing attention to this important matter. “So often we headline potential calamity but fail to celebrate the small wins that enable justice and prevent catastrophic events from taking place. Despite the non-event, this agreement between the parties is a huge achievement, which highlights the role civil society plays in keeping government accountable and protecting the country’s interests over individual greed,” said Adv Stefanie Fick, OUTA’s Chief Legal Officer.
