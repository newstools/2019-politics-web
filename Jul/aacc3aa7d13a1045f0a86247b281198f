SAMWU strike will further worsen erratic service delivery in North West 29 July 2019 The impending strike by the South African Municipal Workers Union (SAMWU) will have dire consequences on service delivery and governance in the North West. SAMWU has threatened to embark on a strike following the non-payment of employee salaries at Bojanala Platinum District Municipality and Tswaing Local Municipality. The ANC is responsible for the financial mismanagement and collapse of service delivery in both these municipalities. SAMWU has long been an ally of the ANC government, backing the ANC-led administration while they looted and ensured the collapse of both municipalities. SAMWU’s threat to go on strike will not resolve the financial crisis and mismanagement that plagues both Bojanala Platinum District Municipality and Tswaing. The DA reiterates its call that the ANC government should get rid of unskilled and compromised officials, and ensure that qualified and fit for purpose individuals are hired to improve the administration of both municipalities. Where the DA governs, we prioritise the appointment of skilled, qualified and experienced officials to ensure that our governments are efficient and responsive to the needs of ordinary citizens.
