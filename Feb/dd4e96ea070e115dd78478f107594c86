SACTWU concerned about 140 000 job loss threat 11 February 2019 The COSATU-affiliated Southern African Clothing & Textile Workers’ Union (SACTWU) is horrified that 140 000 jobs might be lost should the Edcon rescue funding crisis not be resolved within the next day. Should this happen, it will unleash a socio-economic disaster, unprecedented in the recent history of the clothing, textile, footwear and leather sectors. The terrible multiplier effects on the poorest of the poor and the economy at large would be too ghastly to contemplate. Most workers in these sectors are from some of the poorest parts of the country, such as Ladysmith, Isithebe, Newcastle, QwaQwa, Botshabelo, Atlantis, Caledon, Babelegi, Fort Jackson, Zwelitsha, Despatch and Mogwase. All of them are black, and the majority are single mothers supporting, on average, at least 5 family members on their weekly wages. We call on the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) and Public Investment Corporation (PIC) structures to urgently fast-track approval of a priority rescue funding plan for Edcon.  There is no time to delay. We call on all 112 000 SACTWU members throughout the country to support the COSATU strike against job losses on 13 February 2019 and 19 February 2019, to show our rejection of the thousands of jobs which are now being threatened in our industry.
