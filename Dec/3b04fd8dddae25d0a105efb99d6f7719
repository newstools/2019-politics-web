EFF statement on loadshedding 10 December 2019 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));The Economic Freedom Fighters is concerned about the current load shedding carried out by the incompetent leadership of ESKOM and the interfering Minister of Public Enterprises. The EFF believes that the ESKOM leadership of Jabu Mabuza and Pravin Gordhan are deliberately sabotaging ESKOM so as to build a case for rivatization of electricity. The EFF is aware that the current administration of Ramaphosa is working with the greedy capitalist establishment to undermine the power generation capacity of ESKOM so that they can later sell Power stations to the capitalist establishment. This plan is part of the irrational power purchase agreements, which are milking ESKOM of its much needed resources despite the fact that these agreements and all Independent Power Producers carry no foreseeable capacity to provide adequate and dependable electricity to all South Africans. We demand that the entire Board of Eskom and the Minister of Public Enterprises Pravin Gordhan must immediately step down and should never be involved in anything to do with Eskom. A team of Engineers and experts, including those who have ended load shedding before should be appointed to come with a clear maintenance plan which will be rolled out in all power stations. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0']));We demand that all existing Power Purchase agreements entered with IPPs should be discontinued as they add no significant value to South Africaâ€™s electricity needs. We further demand that efforts to unbundle ESKOM should be stopped and the utility given to people who will bring maximum stability before any thought of unbundling is entertained. We demand that Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa must develop some courage and act against incompetence and sabotage because the people who are involved in these are doing so in his name and to benefit his private funders. The people of South Africa should know that the ESKOM crisis is man made at the height of this sabotage is Pravin Gordhan and Jabu Mabuza, who are hell bent of making Eskom dysfunctional so that it can be sold to their capitalist friends.
