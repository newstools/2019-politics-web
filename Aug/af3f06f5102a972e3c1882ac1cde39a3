Western Cape Minister Tertuis Simmers on obloquy 23 August 2019 In politics a good story always trumps facts. Fake sells better than fact. Ask Donald Trump. Ask Boris Johnson. To be (G)ood at concocting a (G)ood story is always (G)ood for political points. And better even to divert voter attention away from dismal failure. The "resurrection" of years-old allegations against me, killed long ago by authorities woke to political expediency and immune to conspiracy and concocted complaints is what a desperate and defeated Good and ANC vainly hope will help ease the excruciating pain and downright embarrassment of recent elections defeats when together they could convince but 1 in 3 voters in the Western Cape of their 'solutions' Did I say "Good and ANC"? Indeed. It's a little cabal of stinkfluencers arrogating informed opinion as thin as their Western Cape support. Our country is burning while the Western Cape delivers consistently on the up. Good and the ANC rise only to snap at the ankles of those who improve lives, and of me, who, with the magnificent and able support of my team, delivers housing opportunities to people disadvantaged; making real the dreams of people on waiting lists; providing dignity even to backyard dwellers. I am moving forward at speed. My detractors are stalled in the past. Issued by Minister Tertuis Simmers, 23 August 2019
