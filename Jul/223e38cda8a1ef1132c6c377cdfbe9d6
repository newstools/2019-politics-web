HSF statement regarding EFF conduct during the budget vote of the Minister of Public Enterprises, the Hon Pravin Gordhan 12 July 2019 The Helen Suzman Foundation notes with great concern the events which took place in Parliament yesterday afternoon, and condemns the behaviour of members of the EFF in the strongest possible way. This sort of conduct, which by any standards amounts to gross intimidation, has no place in our Parliament or our society. We call on the Speaker of Parliament to take the necessary steps to ensure that those responsible for this outrageous behaviour are severely censured, and that the rules of Parliament are adhered to by all Members.
