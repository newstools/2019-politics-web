DA calls on GDE to partner with law enforcement agencies to ensure learners’ safety 9 October 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng is calling on the Gauteng Department of Education to partner with law enforcement agencies to ensure learners’ safety in all our schools across the province. This follows a horrific incident were a 14-year-old grade 9 learner from Thuto-Tiro Comprehensive School in Sebokeng was stabbed to death with a pair of scissors by his schoolmate. This is just one of many incidents that indicate that the safety of our learners and teachers is under threat in Gauteng schools. A learner from Forest High School in Turffontein was also stabbed to death in June this year. Schools are supposed to be safe places for children to learn and it is the responsibility of the Department of Education to ensure that learners are taught in a safe and conducive environment. The DA proposes that law enforcement agencies in partnership with the Department of Education and the Department of Community Safety conduct regular unannounced school searches to ensure that learners do not bring dangerous weapons to school. We call on the MEC for Education, Panyaza Lesufi, MEC for Community Safety, Faith Mazibuko, Metropolitan Police Departments and the Gauteng Provincial SAPS Commissioner, Lieutenant General Elias Mawela to engage and form a partnership that will help to curb violence, murder and other related crimes in our schools. Its high time that MEC Lesufi prioritises learner’s safety ahead of technological improvements in schools. Issued by Nkele Molapo, DA Gauteng Spokesperson on Education, 9 October 2019
