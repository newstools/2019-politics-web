IEB National Senior Certificate 2018 The 2018 pass rate is 98.92%, comparable to last year’s pass rate of 98.76%. All candidates who passed achieved a pass that is good enough to enter tertiary study at one of the three levels: 90.65% (compared to 88.50% in 2017) of the cohort achieved entry to degree study. 7.33% (compared to 8.95% in 2017) qualified for entry to diploma study. 0.95% (compared to 1.30% in 2017) achieved entry for study at the Higher Certificate level. 11 514 full-time and 858 part-time candidates from 249 examination centres across Southern Africa wrote the Independent Examinations Board (IEB) National Senior Certificate (NSC) examinations in October and November 2018. This is an increase from 2017 when there were 11 464 full-time candidates and 666 part-time candidates. Umalusi has monitored all aspects of the 2018 examination process and has declared the results to be fair and valid. There is a clear realisation among IEB learners, their parents and teachers that having the knowledge and understanding that lies behind the results on the certificate is far more important and meaningful for success after one’s schooling. The increase in the percentage pass rate for entry to bachelor degree studies can be attributed to the removal of the list of designated subjects. Previously in addition to the normal pass requirements for the NSC, the attainment of 50% or more in a minimum of 4 designated subjects was required for entry to degree study. In 2018, the list of designated subjects was removed. Learners must still get 50% in a minimum of 4 subjects; however the 50% requirement can apply to any subject excluding Life Orientation. The closing date for the application for re-marking is 10 January 2019 and the results from re-marking will be released on 6 February 2019. The closing date for learner’s who qualify to enrol for the supplementary examination to do so, is 15 February 2019. Advanced Programmes 2018 The Advanced Programme courses are extension courses in Mathematics, English and Afrikaans. They are available to any learner in South Africa attending either state or IEB schools who chooses to participate. The assessment has been benchmarked by UK NARIC, the UK equivalent of the South African Qualifications Authority, and is considered equivalent to the UK A-levels. The 2018 performance in AP Mathematics, consisting of 1 430 learners from IEB schools and 1 246 learners in state schools, has been very pleasing with 79.7% achieving a pass above 40%. From a total of 626 learners offering AP English, 95.5% achieved a pass mark of 40% or above; all learners offering AP Afrikaans achieved a mark of 40% and above. Combined Abitur-NSC 2018 The Combined Abitur-NSC is a qualification offered by the German Schools in Cape Town, Johannesburg and Pretoria. The qualification consists of five subjects assessed by the IEB and seven subjects assessed by the German Education authorities. Through this government-to-government agreement, successful learners in the Combined Abitur-NSC are recognised by German education authorities for entry to German universities and by the South African education authorities for entry to South African universities. Of the 74 candidates who offered this qualification, 97.3% passed with entry to degree study. The IEB sees its involvement with this qualification as a means of keeping South African students in touch with global standards and developments.

These institutions have both full-time and part-time learners who live in areas across the country. They are registered with the distance-learning institution which manages their lesson delivery as well as the assessment requirements, and in Grade 12 these adhere strictly to the NSC requirements and are moderated and verified by the IEB. About the IEB The IEB is an independent assessment agency, separate from State and Provincial examination boards, operating within the constraints of national legislation and provisions of the national quality assurance body, Umalusi. Umalusi has granted the IEB accreditation for the assessment of the National Senior Certificate and adult examinations at NQF Level 1. The IEB offers examinations for client schools at the Grade 12 level, in line with national policy, based on the National Curriculum Statements and using various forms of assessment, including final summative examination and continuous assessment – i.e. orals, practicals and portfolios. The School Section acts in accordance with Umalusi prescriptions and the provisions of Higher Education, using professional educationalists who are practising teachers in the various subject disciplines. These teachers are active members of IEB Subject User Groups which engage with the curriculum and make recommendations on assessment practice based on real school experience. The IEB offers assessments including international benchmarking tests at other levels to participating schools. Statement issued by Anne Oberholzer, IEB, 3 January 2018
