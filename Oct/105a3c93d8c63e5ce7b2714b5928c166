Beneficiaries have a right to choose the payment option that suit them 11 October 2019 South African Social Security Agency would like to advice beneficiaries that they have a right to choose a payment option that suit them. A beneficiary who is not happy about the option he or she selected initially during the phasing out of CPS to South African Post Office can visit any SASSA office to change the payment option. When a beneficiary decide to change a payment option they must visit their nearest SASSA office immediately .They must come along with their identity document and proof of residence. Those who want to change to banks of their own choice, they must include the bank statement or the confirmation letter of the bank account. Beneficiaries must note that the change of payment option occurs immediately, unless when the changes were submitted after the cutoff date. For example when the beneficiary submitted the documents of changing a payment option after the 15 day of the month, the changes of payment option will be effected at the end of the following month. SASSA strives to ensure that all beneficiaries are happy and satisfied about their payment option of choice and other SASSA services.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0'])); Issued by Kenneth Ndlangamandla on behalf of the South African Social Security Agency, 11 October 2019
