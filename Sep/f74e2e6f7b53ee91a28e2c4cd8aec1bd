EFF condemns Ramaphosa's opportunistic and irresponsible statements regarding the death of Pretoria taxi driver 14 September 2019 The EFF condemns the opportunistic and irresponsible statement made by President Ramaphosa relating to the death of Jabu Baloyi, the taxi driver who was killed fighting the selling of drugs. In an address he gave to the community in Tshwane Ramaphosa said: "Your biggest mistake was not voting for the ANC to take over this municipality. This municipality is under the administration of the DA. So, the next time you vote, remember to vote for the ANC, vote right so we can attend to such matters".eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0', 0])); As we speak, ANC presides over provinces with the highest murder rate in the county where not even a single municipality is under the opposition government in the Eastem Cape. A total of 3 965 were murdered in the period 2019 and 2019 alone, that is a murder rate of 60.9 (per 100 000) in a single province. In fact Tshwane has the lowest murder rate of all metros in South Africa. That's according to the 2018/2019 State of Urban Safety in South Africa Report by the South African Cities Network. In Gauteng, the Metro with the highest murder rate is the only one administered by the ANC: Ekurhuleni. Ramaphosa used the condition of Jabu Baloyi to score cheap political points for his party.eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0', 0])); Yet, for over 25 years the ANC has failed all of South Africa to bring safety on our streets. They have also failed to deal with unemployment, inequality and poverty which are central to the high levels of violent crime in our country. A responsible president does not go around scoring cheap political points in times of great national distress.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_0',114,'0', 0])); Issued by Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, National Spokesperson, EFF, 14 September 2019
