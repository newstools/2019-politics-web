No action from ANC on Zandile Gumede: 24 days and counting 7 June 2019 The Democratic Alliance in eThekwini is deeply concerned at the lack of a response from the ANC regarding Zandile Gumede. Despite repeated media reports that action would be taken and she would be fired, the ANC has once again failed the people of eThekwini as Gumede remains in office 24 days after her arrest. It is abundantly clear that Gumede is unfit to lead eThekwini. Under her failing leadership, eThekwini residents have experienced a sharp decline in service delivery from the municipality. It is also obvious that Her term in office has been mired by maladministration, corruption, and capture of the city for ANC political purposes. The investigative report that is the basis for the current prosecution against Gumede goes as far to see that she has attempted to “usurp the function of the City Manager”. This is clear evidence that Gumede is obsessed with interfering in the city’s administration for her own ends. Despite repeated appeals to the ANC and the KZN Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs from the DA to act against Gumede, nothing has been done. She has remained in office and even delivered the city’s budget at great cost to the city’s reputation. The ANC has let down the people of eThekwini continuously protecting the ‘comrade’ that is corrupt and compromised. The DA has been clear from the start- Gumede must go. She is unfit to govern, her role in the latest municipal strike has been devastating for eThekwini, and the charges against her are incredibly severe. Her continued role in the city serves no one but Gumede herself and the ANC. The DA will continue to fight for a clean eThekwini that can deliver services for all. For this to happen, the ANC must fire Zandile Gumede. Issued by Nicole Graham, DA EThekwini Caucus Leader, 7 June 2019
