TLU SA declares no trust in land reform report 12 June 2019 TLU SA noted the presidential advisory panel about land reform and agriculture handing over their report to Pres. Cyril Ramaphosa. “TLU SA is sceptical about this report and holds no positive hope regarding its contents,” says Mr. Henk van de Graaff, Chairperson of TLU SA’s Property Rights Committee. “TLU SA was given no opportunity to add any input, despite us presenting our plan for sustainable agriculture many years ago. Neither the government nor any of its institutions showed any interest in our plan, probably because its focus is on free market principles.” The fact that a minority report – also by organised agriculture – was also compiled, because their inputs were not taken up in the final report, strengthens our suspicion that this report is simply an echo of government’s socialist viewpoints without taking into consideration the proposals of the active farming community. For this reason, we believe the report will once again be a political ideological document, instead of an economic document with a focus on growth. “Therefore, TLU SA puts it on record that we will not be bound by any findings or suggestions in the report and that we will react in full on the content once it is officially presented by Pres. Ramaphosa,” says Van de Graaff. Issued by Henk van de Graaff, Chairperson Property Rights Committee, TLU SA, 12 June 2019
