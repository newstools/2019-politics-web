Finance Deputy Minister Mondli Gungubele must recuse himself from PIC Board 31 January 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) is deeply concerned over allegations that emerged from the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) inquiry on Wednesday, which implicate Chairperson of the Board and Deputy Minister of Finance, Mondli Gungubele, and the acting CEO, Matshepo More. The position that Gungubele holds as Deputy Minister of Finance is one which must be free of any hint of malfeasance. As Chairperson of the Board, Gungubele has an added responsibility to be honest and transparent with regards to the matters raised against him by whistle-blowers. In order to protect his integrity, as well as the reputation of the PIC, it is incumbent upon Mondli Gungubele to recuse himself as Chairperson of the Board, pending the outcomes of the Board instituted investigation against him. He must relinquish his powers and delegate his responsibilities to a candidate who is able to uphold the highest of moral standards. Additionally, Motshepo More should withdraw from the position of acting CEO, until the allegations raised against her are investigated and concluded. There can be no fair investigative process if both these individuals remain in their given positions. By recusing themselves, they are ensuring that no investigator is unduly influenced and that no whistle-blower is intimidated from voicing their concerns. The DA will continue to fight corruption, and reaffirms that under a DA government, anyone found guilty of corruption will face the full consequences of their actions.
