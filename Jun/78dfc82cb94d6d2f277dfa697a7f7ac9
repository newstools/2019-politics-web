HOW TO REACH OUR AUDIENCE GUARANTEED Every weekday Politicsweb selects and publishes our selection of the most essential political statements and communications. We consider all submissions, but can only publish some of them. Such items then appear on our homepage and go out to our newsletter of over 18 000 subscribers. Our readership includes many people of influence - politicians, journalists and opinion-makers. We also have a paid-for service whereby your organisation, for a reasonable price, can reach this audience with relevant and quality content. The headlines for such items will appear in our PR section - which appears high up both on the newsletter and the homepage. The headlines can either link to an item that we post on the site itself, or out to a page on your website. This service is ideal for those seeking to advertise upcoming events (something which we don't do as part of our normal service), reports, job openings, commentary, and so on. We offer discounts for those who would like to make use of this service on a regular basis. If you are interested in taking up this offer please email prservice at the url you would expect.
