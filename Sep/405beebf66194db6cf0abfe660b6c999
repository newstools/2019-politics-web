FF Plus wins another DA wards â€“ shows continued growth and support The result of the by-election in Ward 2 in the JB Marks Municipality (Potchefstroom) serves as proof that support for the FF Plus is continually growing. The FF Plus won this Ward from the DA. This is the second ward that the FF Plus recently won from the DA in the province. Votes for the FF Plus increased with 56% since the 2016 municipal elections, while the DA lost 65% of its votes since then. The FF Plus candidate, Everhard Laing, won the Ward and thus continued the party's growth that started in the North West with the general elections on the 8th of May this year. As ward councillor, Laing will do everything in his power to serve residents and promote their interests. Since the recent national elections, support for the party has more than doubled and the results of the by-elections confirm that the party is continuing to grow and will play a significant role in the 2021 municipal elections. The FF Plus succeeded in obtaining 677 votes in comparison to the DA's 489. Previously, the Ward was under DA control. The ANC got 424 votes. Residents are tired of empty promises and the ANC's looting of municipalities. The FF Plus has already proven that it offers residents, who suffer due to dysfunctional municipal management, real hope. The FF Plus in the North West will continue to build on its victories and will offer feasible solutions to residents who are looking for alternatives to poor service delivery in the province's wards. The FF Plus wants to thank every voter who put their faith in the party and yesterday voted for the growing alternative that will bring about real change. The increased support strengthens the party's mandate to promote its policy and bring about real change. Statement issued by Dr. Pieter Groenewald, FF Plus leader, 19 September 2019
