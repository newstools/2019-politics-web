Tshwane Metro halts implementation of increased electricity tariff 12 July 2019 The Tshwane Metro announced on Friday 12 July 2019 that it will discontinue the implementation of the illegal increased tariff for the 2019/2020 term from 17 July 2019. This follows continued pressure from and even a court case brought by AfriForum against the Metro to halt the process. The discontinuation of the increased tariff is not final, however, and Nersa is yet to approve a tariff for the 2019/2020 term. This decision will be made after seven days that the Tshwane Metro has to provide Nersa with additional information on the tariff that it wants to implement. According to Morné Mostert, AfriForum’s Head of Local Government Affairs, AfriForum welcomes the Metro’s announcement. “We are happy that the increased tariff will no longer be charged. The process was followed incorrectly right from the start. We welcome the Tshwane Metro’s decision to once again apply the previous term’s tariffs and to obtain Nersa’s approval before any increase is implemented. Electricity consumers will now be paying the previous term’s tariffs – without the increase.” Mostert emphasises that only prepaid consumers have been affected by the increased tariffs. The Tshwane Metro undertook to reimburse these consumers by paying back the money that they had to pay extra for units. Mostert adds that the Metro can now start afresh to implement an increased tariff – one that will consider all residents of Pretoria. “It is a pity that we had to start a court process to halt the implementation of the tariff. We hope that the Metro will in future communicate better with its residents to avoid similar action.” AfriForum will continue to monitor the process and participate where necessary. The organisation will in future also cooperate closely with the Metro to ensure a fair tariff for its residents. Issued by Carina Bester, Media Relations Officer, AfriForum, 12 July 2019
