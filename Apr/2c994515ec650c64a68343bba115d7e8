Ace’s IEC complaint against DA an attempt to draw attention away from ANC’s incitement of violence in Alex 17 April 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) has received a complaint from the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) in which the ANC Secretary General, Ace Magashule denies his party’s involvement in orchestrating violent and anarchic protests in a number of municipalities run by the DA. It is clear from a range of factors that the ANC is inciting violence in Alex and that they used the genuine concerns of the people to fight their own narrow political battles. The violent protests were nothing more than an diversion tactic by the ANC to draw attention away from its 25 years of empty promises and corruption. This complaint to the IEC will not take away from the concrete evidence the DA and the City of Johannesburg has uncovered regarding the ANC’s hand in the violent protests in DA-led municipalities. We have evidence that ANC officials were behind Alexandra shutdown and have subsequently lodged a complaint with the IEC.  This is further strengthened by the fact that Mayor Herman Mashaba has established that the protests, were in part, led by the ANC ward councillor. The choice before South Africa is clear, vote for a party that shamelessly uses the genuine plight of poor people for its own narrow political benefits, or a party that will hold its leaders accountable regardless of who they are. Only the DA has a clear vision that will build One South Africa for All. Issued by Solly Malatsi, DA National Spokesperson, 17 April 2019
