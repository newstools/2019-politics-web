Government condemns vandalism in Tshwane 30 July 2019 Government notes with concern the strike in the City of Tshwane by South African Municipal Workers Union members that is accompanied by reports of vandalism to infrastructure and intimidation of the members of the public. Government acknowledges the right of workers to strike but the conduct of some of the striking workers is unacceptable and undermines the rights of those who are not part of the strike. Union leaders have a responsibility to educate their members about the need to restrain themselves during strikes and not to embark on illegal activities. Government reiterates its condemnation of any form of violence and intimidation during strikes and will not tolerate lawlessness. Dialogue must prevail at all times between employers and employees to ensure that disputes are resolved peacefully while promoting the right to freedom to protest. Government calls on all parties concerned to reach an amicable and speedy resolution. South Africa is a democratic country where concerns ought to be addressed within the framework of the law. Government calls on law enforcement agencies to act decisively to protect citizens and public property. Issued on behalf of Phumla Williams, 30 July 2019
