Tshwane Metro implements increased electricity tariff without Nersa approval 2 July 2019 On Monday 1 July 2019 the Tshwane Metro implemented an increased tariff that was not approved by the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa). This follows after Nersa decided on 28 June that the proposed tariff may not be implemented before further information was supplied and Nersa could implement its processes. Under Section 14 of the Electricity Regulation Act, 2006 (Act No. 4 of 2006) the municipality may not implement an increased electricity tariff without Nersa’s approval. Jaco Grobbelaar, AfriForum’s District Coordinator for Greater Pretoria, says this is however not the case. “Tshwane Metro continued with the implementation of the increased tariff despite Nersa’s decision. The metro made a unilateral decision that does not take the residents of Pretoria into account.” Grobbelaar voices his concern about the implemented tariff. “Everyone is currently unsure. The fact that three different tariff increases were announced to date and the council deciding on another tariff on Thursday leaves everyone in the dark about the actual tariff that was implemented. The Tshwane Metro also doesn’t play open cards with the public and fails to provide feedback on any of the letters AfriForum has sent.” AfriForum will continue to consult with its legal team to ensure that the right processes are followed and that the increased tariff is reasonable. AfriForum implores the residents of Pretoria to become involved to have this unfair process set aside.
