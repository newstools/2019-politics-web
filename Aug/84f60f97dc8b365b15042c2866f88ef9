Cabinet must be held responsible for consequences of ANC’s pension looting plan 19 August 2019 The Cabinet must accept responsibility for the consequences of the ANC's plan to take money from public and private pension funds and use it to settle the debt of struggling public enterprises. The proposal made by the ANC chairperson of the Subcommittee for Economic Transformation, Enoch Godongwana, comes down to wealth looting and it will only hamper the already struggling South African economy even further. This plan seems to suggest that the government, as an institution with a poor credit rating, is desperate and that the ANC puts ideology before what is in the best interest of South Africa. South Africans must now join forces with the FF Plus and put their foot down to prevent any further looting of our country’s wealth.
