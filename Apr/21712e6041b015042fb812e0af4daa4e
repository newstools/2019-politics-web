Home Affairs on ‘election robbers’ who masquerade as Home Affairs officials 5 April 2019 The Department of Home Affairs has warned members of the public that mischievous ‘election robbers’ who masquerade as Home Affairs officials are at it again, robbing people, ahead of the 2019 general elections. The scammers pretend to be Home Affairs officials so they can gain access to homes. They are in possession of letterheads purportedly from the Department of Home Affairs and claim the purpose of their visit is to confirm the validity of IDs for the elections. They then rob the unsuspecting members of the public of their valuables. There is no initiative of this nature from Home Affairs. “We don’t come to your homes to validate your IDs, you come to us, as citizens, for IDs and other services”, acting Home Affairs Director-General Thulani Mavuso said. People must be careful at this time, and protect their lives, loved ones and their property. Issued by Department of Home Affairs, 5 April 2019
