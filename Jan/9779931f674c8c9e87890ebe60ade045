DA calls for Rail Enforcement Unit in Gauteng 9 January 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) is calling on the Gauteng Provincial Government (GPG) to establish a Rail Enforcement Unit, as has been done in vulnerable rail routes in the Western Cape, in order to keep both commuters and infrastructure safe. This follows the deadly train accident in Tshwane yesterday in which three people were killed and scores injured. It is unacceptable that the lives of our commuters are put at risk on a daily basis. A Rail Enforcement Unit, established with resources from provincial government, local government and the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) will help to curb the vandalism of trains and deter cable theft. The DA has been continuously calling for more stringent rail safety measures to put in place to ensure the safety of rail passengers. It is clear that the failing ANC is unable to ensure that public transport infrastructure is well maintained and kept secure. A vote for the DA is a vote for a safe and reliable rail service in Gauteng. Issued byÂ John Moodey, DA Team One Gauteng Spokesperson on Public Transport, 9 January 2019
