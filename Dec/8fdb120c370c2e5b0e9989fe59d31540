Far East Rand hospital CEO appointed despite gross dishonesty charges 5 December 2019 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));The new CEO of the Far East Rand Hospital, Dr Zachariah Mathaba, was appointed despite facing charges of gross dishonesty for allegedly being paid overtime for two years that he did not fulfil. This is revealed by Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku in a written reply to my questions in the Gauteng Legislature. According to Masuku, he was charged on 7 January this year for “gross dishonesty in that he applied for commuted/fixed overtime from 1 September 2017 to 31 March 2018, and 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019 and did not fulfil his commuted overtime contractual obligation.” This occurred when he was a doctor at the ThelleMogoerane Hospital. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_3',113,'0','0']));Masuku says that “normal disciplinary process is ongoing on the matter.” I am shocked that Dr Mathaba was appointed despite serious charges against him that had not been finalized since January this year. I suspect that the charges were covered up and only came to light as a result of my question after I received a tip off about it. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2',114,'0','0']));This highlights slow discipline and lack of scrutiny for applicants for senior jobs. This should never have slipped through and I hope Masuku rectifies the situation as soon as possible. Issued by Jack Bloom,DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC, 5 December 2019
