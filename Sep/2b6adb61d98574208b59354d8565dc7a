DA calls for swift action following the senseless killing of 4 children in Pinetown 4 September 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) is devastated by the news of the gruesome murder of 4 children in the Pinetown, Durban area. It is alleged that the father killed the children aged 4, 6, 10 and 16. The three younger children were found hanged at their home while the eldest was found hanged in a bush in New Germany. This incident happened as the country is being confronted with numerous violent incidents against women and children. The country is spiraling towards anarchy and mayhem because of indecisive leadership. We believe that the time for talking and making empty promises is over. President Ramaphosa needs to act and act decisively so that these gruesome acts are both prosecuted with the severity they deserve and investigations are conducted expediently so that perpetrators can be brought to account. The DA in KZN is meeting with the family of the mother of the children this afternoon. We call upon men to stand up and defend women and children under this scourge. South Africa is no longer safe for women to live in. Every 8 hours a woman is killed and at least half of these women die at the hands of their intimate partners.
