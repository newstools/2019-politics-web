EFF not moved by SANEF and its double standard on so-called investigative journalists 14 September 2019 EFF is not moved by SANEFS Statement boycott Of Daily Maverick, its amaBhungane and Scorpio investigative units. The EFF has the right to freedom of association. We will never be able to stop anyone from writing anything they want about EFF but we have the right to decide who we associate with own events and platforms.eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0', 0])); This right is not infringement at all, of the journalists to express themselves freely. They can express themselves freely, but not at the expense of our right to choose who we associate with. Where was SANEF when this media cabal was digging at EFF leaders' dustbins in a pure attempt to discredit their persons? Where is SANEF when they repeat the same story of RI6 million VBS money for more than a year, at the expense of the rest of the R2 billion that was lost to the bank? What action did SANEF demand when a journalist insulted EFF leadership outside the HAWKS Offices in Silverton, Pretoria? We have it on good record that these George Soros funded journalist units are working with politicians to discredit the EFF. Is the digging of EFF leaders' dustbins not conduct consistent with Stratcom? Are these tactics of discrediting the character of the EFF leadership not consistent with the Indian cabal that Pravin Gordhan led in 1980's during the UDF days?eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0', 0])); Journalism is meant to be grounded on an ethical and independent ethos. Once journalists are directly furthering political objectives, they cease to be journalists. EFF refuses to be forced to associate with people who are politicised, masquerading as innocent journalists. They are all in a personal pursuit of the EFF, seeking its destruction and ultimate end. We choose to associate only with independent, ethical and upstanding journalists.
