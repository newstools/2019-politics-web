Adjustment budget will build One Tshwane for All 1 March 2019 The DA congratulates Tshwane Mayor, Stevens Mokgalapa and his team for passing a pro-poor adjustment budget that will continue the good work of building one Tshwane for all that the DA-led multiparty administration has done in Tshwane since assuming office in 2016. Through this budget, more funds have been made available to enhance service delivery and improve the lives of our people. Mayor Mokgalapa must also be commended for his swift action regarding the Glad Africa contract. Upon election to the position of Mayor, Mokgalapa made a commitment to the people of Tshwane that this issue would be dealt with effectively. The unanimous council resolution to terminate the Glad Africa contract only two weeks since taking over the reins in the City shows that Mayor Mokgalapa is a man of his word and that under his watch, the people of Tshwane are in good hands. The DA does not shy away from the hard choices that need to be made in ensuring good governance. This is the DA difference. This is the kind of accountability that a DA-led Provincial Government will bring to the people of Gauteng after the 2019 May General Election. Issued by John Moodey, DA Gauteng Provincial Leader, 1 March 2019
