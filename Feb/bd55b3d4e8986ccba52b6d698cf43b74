365 Esidimeni victims still not paid compensation 26 February 2019 365 victims of the Life Esidimeni tragedy have still not been paid compensation as determined by Justice Dikgang Moseneke’s Arbitration ruling. This was revealed today by Premier David Makhura in an oral reply to my questions today in the Gauteng Legislature. Makhura said that R164 million had been paid to 134 claimants who were part of the arbitration process, and also to an additional four new claimants. According to Makhura, a verification process involving the Master of the High Court has to be done for the remaining 365 claimants as there are disputes as to the rightful person for each claim. He did not expect the payments to take that long in terms of the agreed process. I am concerned that the payments have been unduly delayed by inefficiency in the Premier’s Office. Furthermore, it would cost about R431 million to pay the 365 claimants, but only R118 million was provided for in the Adjustment Budget in November last year. Where will the missing R313 million to pay all the claimants come from? It is unlikely that all the victims will be paid by the time that Makhura ends his term of office on 8 May, which is a sad comment on a tragedy that will always blight his premiership. It is shameful that he has not given a higher priority to expediting full financial redress for the suffering of the Esidimeni victims.
