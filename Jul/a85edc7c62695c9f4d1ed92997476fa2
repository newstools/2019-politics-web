KZN: Huge under-spending by entities in 2018/19 30 July 2019 The total combined under-spending by all the entities amounted to R1 045 677 B. Of these entities, the four big culprits that top the list of under-spenders are; Richards Bay IDZ by R354 553 M. Ezemvelo by R266 770 M. Ithala by R147 450 M. Dube Trade Port by R119 920 M. “This is totally unacceptable. It is robbing the people of KwaZulu Natal the much-required capital injection into the economy, denying them the much-required job opportunities and robbing them of their services which should have been delivered,” said Hon VF Hlabisa, Leader of the Official Opposition in KwaZulu Natal. “At a time like this, when the economy is going down, jobs getting lost, we cannot allow such complacency in the public service. Those responsible must be brought to book,” continued Hlabisa. The IFP will be asking questions to all the line function departments of all these entities. The IFP believes that there can be no reasonable explanation for this kind of carelessness in public spending. “If KZN is serious about accountability, heads must roll in the public service as the very same entities will be asking for more money again in 2019/20 whilst failing to spend what is already with them,” concluded Hlabisa.
