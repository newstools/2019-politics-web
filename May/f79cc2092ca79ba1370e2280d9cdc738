Mayor Plato urges victim of alleged wrongful arrest to open a case with Police Ombud 24 May 2019 While the South African Police Service (SAPS) does not report to the City of Cape Town and comment is awaited from the SAPS regarding the alleged wrongful arrest of Ms Esethu Mcinjana, the City has already reported the matter to the Western Cape Police Ombudsman for a full investigation. I would like to urge Ms Mcinjana to please contact the Ombudsman’s Office and personally report her unfortunate incident for investigation. From the video that has been posted online and the claims that have been made by Ms Mcinjana I am concerned about the alleged conduct of the SAPS. While the SAPS have a duty to protect our communities they also have a duty to conduct themselves professionally and to treat all suspects respectfully. The SAPS is a National Government entity and the City has no authority over it. It must be stated that members of the public are not prohibited from taking photos of uniform law enforcement personnel. The City’s Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security, Alderman JP Smith, has previously circulated a memo reminding the City’s own law enforcement officers that it is within the rights of members of the public to take photos of staff in their uniform. I would like to urge the National Government to do the same for its law enforcement personnel. The City is an inclusive and caring city and we cannot allow our residents to be treated disrespectfully. The Western Cape Police Ombudsman can be contacted on 021 483 0669 or ombudsman@wcpo.gov.za. The Ombud seeks to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of police services and to improve relations between the SAPS and the communities by investigating complaints of police inefficiency and/ or a breakdown of relations between the SAPS and any community.
