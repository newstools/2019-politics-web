Noting the intrinsic importance of signal distribution in this discourse, the Ministers advised the parties to also invite SENTECH to the meeting. Ministers Mthembu and Ndabeni-Abrahams reiterate that the community media sector is an important vehicle that plays a catalytic development role, offering an alternative voice to communities and advancing social cohesion. It is therefore important that the sector be provided with all the necessary support to be compliant and sustainable in the changing communications landscape. Whilst cognisant of the above, the Ministers call upon the community media sector to ensure compliance with legislative requirements as set in the Electronic Communications Act and utilise existing support mechanisms provided by both ICASA and MDDA, including the commitment by Government to reach out to communities using these platforms through the Government Communication and Information System (GCIS).eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0'])); The Ministers have also resolved to continue engagements with the respective portfolio entities towards finalising a support strategy which is imperative in finding a lasting solution for the sustainability of community media.
