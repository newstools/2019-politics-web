Said was one of the country’s best television journalists having joined ETV during the channel’s early days and his loss to the country’s media industry will be felt. The death of a journalist of Said’s calibre makes the media profession poorer. The industry, and in particular journalists, plays a critical role in shaping public discourse, equipping citizens with information, and strengthening the country's democracy.
