DA welcomes High Court dismissal of Jiba application for reinstatement 18 October 2019 The Western Cape Division of the High Court today dismissed the application of Nomcgobo Jiba to compel President Cyril Ramaphosa and the National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP), Advocate Shamila Batohi, to reinstate her with immediate effect with full benefits.  The Democratic Alliance (DA) is delighted with this outcome. In dismissing the application, the Court found that Ms Jiba had not made out a case. This is good news for South Africa, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) and for Adv Batohi. Ms Jiba has been instrumental in hollowing out the NPA and setting the course for where we find ourselves today - rampant corruption on a grand scale with no consequences.  The mess that has been left for Adv Batohi to clean up was largely caused by Jiba, Lawrence Mwrebi and Shaun Abrahams. Had she been reinstated,  it would have been nothing short of disasterous for the resurrection of the NPA.  The toxic influence that Ms Jiba wielded cannot be overstated and any hope of righting the ship would have been destroyed by her return. The criminal justice system is well rid of Ms Jiba and her total disregard for her constitutional duty and the Rule of Law.
