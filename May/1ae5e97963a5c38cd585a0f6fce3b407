STATEMENT OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE ANC ON THE POSTPONEMENT OF DEPUTY PRESIDENT MABUZA'S SWEARING INTO THE NA The National Officials of the African National Congress (ANC) have received and agreed to a request by the ANC Deputy President, Comrade David Mabuza, to postpone his swearing in as a member Of the National Assembly scheduled for 22 May 2019. The Deputy President made the request in light of a report by the ANC Integrity Commission in which he is alleged to have prejudiced the integrity of the ANC and brought the organisation into disrepute. The Deputy President has indicated he would like to have an opportunity to address the Integrity Commission on these allegations. In the meantime, he has decided nevertheless to follow the dictates of his conscience and postpone his swearing in as a member of the National Assembly out of respect for the ANC's institutions and processes. The Deputy President believes that the ANC as a governing party should advance the electoral mandate in an environment of public trust. The ANC commends Deputy President Mabuza for the stance he has taken and I personally applaud his resolve to put the interests of the ANC first. Issued by Cyril Ramaphosa, President of the African National Congress, 22 May 2019
