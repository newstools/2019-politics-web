Government needs to do more to prevent festive road fatalities 16 January 2019 The DA is shocked and saddened by the thousands of South Africans who lost their lives in road fatalities over the festive season. Minister Blade Nzimande revealed today that road fatalities over the festive season increased to 1 612. This is a 5.56% from the previous year’s fatality rate of 1 527. These numbers once again reiterate the need for a more effective road safety strategy, not just over the festive season, but throughout the year. The DA has for years been calling for government to change its strategy on road safety. Yet, the government has continuously followed the same strategy that has been shown to do nothing to improve conditions on our roads. We need a road safety strategy which goes beyond only stopping motorists to check drivers and vehicle licenses. By Nzimande’s own admission, this year 90% of fatalities are because of human factors. Despite this fact and research commissioned by the transport entity, the Road Traffic Management Corporation, no road safety strategy exists that address these issues head on. The DA will be tabling Questions in Parliament to the Minister to explain these statistics and why no alternative strategy exists to address the real causes for road deaths. A DA remains committed to seeing our roads become safer for all South Africans. Issued by Manny De Freitas, DA Shadow Minister of Transport, 16 January 2019
