Independent Electoral Commission meets Democratic Alliance over complaints 24 April 2019 Members of the Commission today met with the leadership of the Democratic Alliance at its request to discuss matters pertaining to complaints lodged by the party. Such engagements with political parties contesting elections – either bilaterally or via multilateral structures such as the party liaison committees - are essential avenues for communication and cooperation in the run-up to elections and the Commission welcomes the cordial and constructive spirit in which the meeting was conducted. The Commission has carefully listened to the issues raised by the DA leaders and has sought to clarify concerns where such concerns were raised. Where issues of disagreement on matters of law arose, as was the case in one of the issues raised by the DA (namely the Democratic Alliance vs the Electoral Commission, the Good Party and the African National Congress) the Commission welcomes the constructive approach to seek clarity from the courts. What is important for the Commission is to respond to issues raised by its stakeholders directly with them and not through the media. While it understands the significant public interest in such matters, the Commission appeals to all stakeholders including political parties and the media to respect the legal process and to await the judgment of the courts in these matters. The Commission denies any suggestion it has acted with prejudice or partiality in dealing with any complaints. Issued by Independent Electoral Commission, 24 April 2019
