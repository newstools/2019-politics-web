Zimbabweans will suffer for South Africa’s Quiet Diplomacy 16 January 2019 The anemic response of the South African government to the violence and intimidation being carried out against civilians is an abhorrent manifestation of the failed ANC policy of ‘quiet diplomacy’. The government of Zimbabwe is currently under the leadership of retired general and Vice President Constantino Chiwenga while President Emmerson Mnangagwa undertakes a four-nation tour before heading to Davos. Chiwenga has unleashed violence on Zimbabweans who are protesting against a crippling fuel hike. Internet access has been cut off which means the world is receiving limited information about the gross human rights violations that have been alleged in Zimbabwe. Yesterday, the Department of International Relations and Cooperation simply ‘noted’ the protest action and expressed confidence that ‘that the measures being taken by the Zimbabwean Government will resolve the situation.’ This was followed by remarks by the Minister of Finance Tito Mboweni today, who has called for an end to sanctions against Zimbabwe. South Africa needs a government worthy of the mantle of a global and continental leader. We must not tolerate the tepid statements of a government rendered ineffective in its foreign policy because of its own decision to consort with dictators across the continent rather than siding with civilians in desperate need of our support. The DA will certainly not support any move to reward the violence and repression in Zimbabwe by joining the call for the lifting of sanctions against members of the Zimbabwe government. We stand with the people of Zimbabwe and we call on the administration of President Ramaphosa to do the same immediately.
