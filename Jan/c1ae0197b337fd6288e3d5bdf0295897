eThekwini administration in disarray as Mayor denies any deal 22 January 2019 The Democratic Alliance in eThekwini has noted Mayor Zandile Gumede’s response on the Jacob Zuma record deal. At Tuesday’s Executive Committee meeting, Gumede denied any record deal existed and rebuked the media for running the story without ‘facts’. It is clear that the failing ANC is buckling under DA and public pressure. Whilst we welcome this backtrack, this proves exactly what the DA has been saying- that eThekwini’s Parks Unit has gone rogue, and that the tail is wagging the proverbial dog in Durban. The City Manager has refused to pronounce on the issue, despite numerous requests from the DA, nor have they publicly rebuked Parks Head Thembinkosi Ngcobo’s utterances about the deal. Whilst the DA welcomes the halt of this project, it’s clear that the city’s political and administrative leadership is in disarray. It’s unclear why or how senior councillors and officials were permitted to visit Zuma and publicly announce the move. eThekwini urgently needs policy and political leadership and direction. Under the failing ANC, the city is jerking from pillar to post and losing the confidence of its residents and future investors. The DA will continue to fight this preposterous proposal and ensure city money is spent fairly and in the interests of service delivery.
