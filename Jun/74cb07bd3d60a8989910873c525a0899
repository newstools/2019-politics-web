AfriForum welcomes arrests of four alleged farm attackers 13 June 2019 AfriForum welcomes the news that four suspects, who allegedly have been involved in the Klapmuts farm attack of 4 June 2019, have been taken into custody. “It doesn’t happen often that suspects are apprehended shortly after farm attacks and we welcome the efforts of the police to make this happen. As Western Cape community we must, however, start to think proactively,” says Johandré van Zyl, AfriForum’s Head of Safety for the Southern region. After the murder of Tool Wessels in May this year one suspect was also apprehended swiftly. Crime in the Western Cape is in the spotlight the past week after various murders in this province. According to AfriForum the murder rate in the Western Cape is more than enough reason for Bheki Cele, Minister of Police, to act and also to set up and implement proactive action plans. According to Adv. Albert Fritz, MEC for Community Safety in the Western Cape, 1 875 murders have been committed in this province the past six months. Adv. Fritz compared it to a war. AfriForum has addressed letters to Alan Winde, Western Cape Premier, and Adv. Fritz in an effort to establish cooperation in the province. AfriForum will also write to Lt Gen. Khombinkosi Jula, the Provincial Commissioner of Police. “AfriForum wants to take hands with the police and the provincial government in all areas – rural and urban. Crime in South Africa hasn’t been the problem of the police alone for a long time. Civil rights organisations like AfriForum also have a role to play to help the police, but the police must intervene as primary role players. “It is AfriForum’s understanding that a meeting between Adv. Fritz and Minister Cele is being planned and we support the Western Cape government in getting assistance from the minister,” says Van Zyl.
