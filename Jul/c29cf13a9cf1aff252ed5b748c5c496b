Another Free State farm attack, time for Police action to protect our rural communities 28 July 2019 Only six days after the Democratic Alliance expressed its concern on the murder of a farmer in the Free State in the Frankfort district, Mr Mazibuko, and further reiterated the urgency to government to establish specialised rural safety units to improve safety and security in rural areas, another farm attack occurred in the Free State. Pieter de Klerk and Marlene Smit were attacked on Friday evening, 26 July, by five armed men on the farm Vanderwaltsrus in the Vredefort district. The DA is grateful that they are out of danger and wishes to emphasise that we will not stop fighting at every level of government to bring about much-needed change in strategy through the implementation and effective monitoring of rural safety units, to protect our rural communities. Our farmers remain national assets who deserve the support and protection of their government. Issued by Mariette Pittaway, Whip of the Official Opposition in the Free State Provincial Legislature. 28 July 2019
