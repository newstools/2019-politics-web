EFF statement of gratitude on electoral growth 13 May 2019 The EFF extends deep and sincere gratitude to the people of South Africa who came out in their numbers to vote on 08 May 2019. We pay special attention to all who voted for the EFF, increasing our electoral support by 70% across the country. We do not take it for granted that in each of the 09 provinces more people believe in the EFF than they did in 2016 and 2014. It is a sign that our revolution is on cause and soon it shall be realized and accomplished. We therefore vow to continue the struggle with even higher intensity for the realization of economic freedom in our lifetime. Thank you South Africa, you will never regret voting for the EFF.
