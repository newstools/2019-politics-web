DA calls for failing Rand West City to be placed under administration The Democratic Alliance (DA) has written to the Gauteng MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, (COGTA), Lebogang Maile, to request that the failing ANC-led Rand West City Municipality be placed under partial administration, in terms of Section 139 (1) (b) of the Constitution, as service delivery has totally collapsed. Please find attached here a letter addressed to the COGTA MEC, Lebogang Maile.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0'])); It is unacceptable that MEC Maile has not yet intervened in this matter, when he is aware that this municipality has failed to fulfil its executive obligations in terms of the Constitution. The Rand West City Municipality which is a merger between the former Randfontein and Westonaria Municipalities, faces many challenges including poor leadership, mismanagement, and mounting debt. The municipality currently owes Eskom R235 621 979 for the supply of bulk electricity, does not have the ability to collect revenue, having only managed to collect 57%, has a refuse collection backlog, and unattended sewer spillages and illegal dumping.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0'])); Last year, the municipality admitted to the SA Human Rights Commission that its waste water treatment works was not fully operational‚ resulting in untreated sewage spilling into land surrounding the plant. There has been no improvement as streets are still flooded by sewage. Thousands of residents and businesses will face a black Christmas, after Eskom announced that it would roll out power cuts due to the escalating debt. As the DA, we are committed to transparent and clean governance that offers quality services to the people.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2',114,'0','0'])); The DA is the only party that can bring about positive change that builds one South Africa for all.
