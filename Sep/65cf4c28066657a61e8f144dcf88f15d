Deputy President Mabuza condemns the murder of UCT student 3 September 2019 Deputy President David Mabuza, in his capacity as the Patron of the Moral Regeneration Movement, has joined President Cyril Ramaphosa in condemning, in the strongest terms possible, the murder and alleged rape of 19 year-old University of Cape Town (UCT) film and media student, Ms Uyinene Mrwetyana, who was earlier reported missing. Her body has been positively identified by her family and a 42 year old man, reportedly a South African Post Office employee, has since appeared in court, charged with her murder and alleged rape. "Words are simply inadequate to describe the pain and horror the Mrwetyana family and friends have been through in the past week since their daughter was reported missing," said the Deputy President. "While we commend the Police for the swift apprehension of the alleged perpetrator and urge the law enforcement and our courts to deliver justice for the young student, we wish to reiterate our strong conviction of a terrible breakdown of the moral fibre of our society where such violence and ultimately the murder of women continues unabated.” “We further note with alacrity that the alleged perpetrator is one of our public servants, an employee entrusted with a position of service and duty to society. We believe that something drastic and immediate must be done in our communities that breed such wanton criminality and cruel behaviour, which must be taken up by community leaders, together with Government, to return the moral fibre to our society,"  said Deputy President Mabuza. The Deputy President wishes to convey his sincerest condolences to the Mrwetyana family, relatives and friends of the deceased student.
