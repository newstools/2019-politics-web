ANC Left With No Choice But To Suspend Zandile Gumede 10 June 2019 The Inkatha Freedom Party Youth Brigade in eThekwini Region notes the decision taken by the ANC over this past weekend to place Zandile Gumede on leave from being the Mayor of eThekwini until the investigation pending against her be finalised. This however does not mean that Zandile Gumede is off the hook and that the ANC is enacting accountability. The City of eThekwini deserves better. Zandile Gumedeâ€™s placement on leave as Mayor came after the IFP Youth Brigade marched to the Durban City Hall in handing over a memorandum of grievances calling for her removal within the municipality. After the Mayor was released on bail she was ordered by the court not to be involved in the daily running of the municipality, but she defied the court order and proceeded to on the 29th May 2019 deliver the municipal budget speech. We believe that there is no smoke without fire. The ANC promised the people of South Africa that they would take a tough stance to corrupt individuals within their ranks yet we are still subjected to their poor and wanting leadership in every sphere of government. The IFPYB will very closely monitor developments in this matter over the next 30 Day leave period granted to Zandile Gumede. We are hopeful that there will be no undue influence exercised by the ANC in this investigation. Issued by Siyabonga Ntombela on behalf of IFP, 10 June 2019
