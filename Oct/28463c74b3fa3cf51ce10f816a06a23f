ANC shows once again that it has lost touch with the reality of failed local government 10 October 2019 The ANC's shocking incompetence and disregard for the seriousness of the collapse of local government in South Africa was once again glaringly obvious as the Department of Cooperative Governance did not send anyone to attend the meeting of the parliamentary portfolio committee for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (COGTA), which was held in the Department's very own buildings in Pretoria. In addition, the Department still has not yet finalised its annual report because its financial statements were submitted late to the Auditor-General (AG) for the annual audit. This serves as proof that the government is not serious about local government and that its excuse that all local government's problems were inherited from Apartheid is void of all truth. The problems are mainly caused by the ANC government's own incompetence and the failure of local government systems and structures due to Affirmative Action, cadre deployment, corruption and fraud. The FF Plus feels that the Department's actions, i.e. not appearing before the Committee and not even making apologies, border on arrogance and a sheer disregard for one of the greatest crises that our country is facing as regards local government. It boils down to undermining the relevant Committee. It is clear that the ANC is merely doing crisis control on all levels of government in South Africa and is not acting in the best interest of taxpayers. The FF Plus will continue to expose the government's flaws so that voters can make a truly informed decision with the local government elections in 2021.
