Congratulations and 'sterkte' Mr President 23 May 2019 The FW de Klerk Foundation wishes to congratulate Mr Cyril Matamela Ramaphosa on being elected unopposed as President of the Republic of South Africa. We have, in the beginning of his tenure as President, often stated that we will support him in his endeavours to re-instate clean government, eradicate State capture and corruption, and rejuvenate the economy. We have also stated that in this, we will watch him closely. We therefore welcome his first statements after his election as President, inter alia that he will serve all the people of South Africa, and not just the ANC; that he will (as Madiba), not lose touch with the needs of ordinary South Africans, and that he will collaborate constructively with leaders of opposition parties to find and implement solutions for our predicament. These are the words of a statesman and stand in stark contrast to the views and actions of his predecessor. As correctly pointed out by some leaders in Parliament, President Ramaphosa has, in terms of section 83(c) of the Constitution, a specific duty to promote nation-building. We hope that in his pledge to work with various stakeholders, he will keep this in mind, and give special attention to the position of the various minorities in our country. Mr President, we wish you well in your huge task and calling. We will not wish you good luck, because luck has nothing to do with your challenges. May God grant you courage and wisdom - and we wish you “sterkte”! Issued by Megan Dick, Communications and Marketing Manager, FW de Klerk Foundation, 23 May 2019
