Statement of the ANC on Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi's stepping down as IFP President 25 August 2019 The African National Congress Wishes outgoing Inkata Freedom party leader prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi well as he steps down as IFP leader. Prince Buthelezi has led the IFP for over 40 years and remains one of the key roleplayers in the struggle for democracy in South Africa. Having been a member Of the African National Congress in the late 1940's throughout most of the apartheid era, Prince Buthelezi was considered one of the foremost black leaders. He played a key role in creating a framework for a negotiated solution to South Africa's racial conflict. Following the 1994 general election, Prince Buthelezi led the IFP to join the government of national unity, led by our global icon Tata Nelson Mandela. Despite acrimonious relations between the ANC and the IFP at the time, as a unifier in his own right, prince Buthelezi accepted the responsibility to serve as Minister Of Home Affairs from 1998 until 2004. We congratulate Prince Buthelezi for his continued commitment to the values of our constitutional democracy and wish him well as he steps aside as leader of the IFP. At the same time, we urge the newly-elected IFP leadership to tap into his wisdom as they prepare to take over the reigns of the party. Issued by Pule Mabe, National Spokesperson, ANC, 25 August 2019
