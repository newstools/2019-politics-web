GDE fails our children by allowing shocking conditions to persist at schools 30 September 2019 Following a complaint from a member of the public, Alan Fuchs MPL, the DA’s Constituency Head for Lenasia together with Cllr Dave Dewes, visited the Apex Primary School in Lenasia. This is not the first complaint about this particular school or the first site visit. In January of this year, the DA’s Shadow MEC for Education in Gauteng, Khume Ramulifho MPL, together with the former Constituency Head and councillors visited the school but were denied entry. This obstructive attitude by the school management and the poor state of the school was reported to the Gauteng Department of Education (GDE), which responded by undertaking to deal with the concerns raised. The most recent visit showed conclusively that the Department of Education has reneged on its undertakings.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0'])); Despite the department indicating that necessary repairs relating to the leaking roofs and the ablution block had been fixed the conditions at this school remain in an appalling condition. The school grounds were covered with litter, the paving is crumbling, the paint is peeling off the buildings, the toilets are in an appalling state and allegations of overcrowding persist. It is alleged that the learners are responsible for the littering. Why is the management of the school not able or willing to provide the necessary oversight and discipline in this regard is a question that must be asked.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2',114,'0','0'])); The fact that the floors of some of the toilet facilities were covered with water and mud and other facilities were locked because they are not functional is contrary to the obligations of the Education Department as far as the legislated infrastructural norms and standards are concerned. The Gauteng Education MEC, Panyaza Lesufi and the management of the Education Department should not be allowed to treat our children with contempt. They must be, and will be, held to account.
