WC Minister Tertuis Simmers on Good’s Electrical Storm in a Teacup 6 October 2019 The premier's response to a dreadful knock-on by the Secretary-General of Good, Brett Herron, is clearly above the grasp of the good folk at what arrogates to be a not so good brains trust.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0'])); Premier Winde did not on any version of the facts "condone" the "consumption of electricity without payment", as claimed by Good in an umpteenth futile attempt today at scoring points any points in a game it is losing by an embarrassing margin, when no such consumption went unpaid! And likewise, the premier cannot 'exonerate" me for consumption of electricity without payment when no such consumption went unpaid. Exactly how dense are the folks at Good? A reminder - perhaps this time the (not so) Good leaders get it: The George Municipality's report on a desk-top investigation to reasonably estimate the average electricity use at the residence for a suggested period during which the pre-paid meter had been compromised - used to assess the amount of income lost by the municipality by tampering - indicates no undue reduction in electricity purchases at all. My electricity purchases remained constant within a reasonable margin of error, irrespective of the operational status of the box. Whoever tampered with the box, before or during my tenancy, did so without my knowledge or observation, and the tampering had no effect on my electricity purchases. After volumes of submissions and hours and days wasted on feeding a fib, Good's bad little storm in a teacup is proving to be no more than a hiccup that had freezed up.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0'])); Good needs get better. I am moving forward at speed. My detractors are stalled in the past.
