SACP calls on SAA tobe transparent about cost-drivers to meaningful consultation to resolve the strike and reposition SAA towards success 15 November 2019 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_4',112,'0','0']));The South African Communist Party (SACP) is concerned and worried about the ease and cavalier manner in which the South African Airways (SAA) management has approached the workers’ strike which started today at the airline, while at the same time claiming that the strike will impact the SAA negatively or even push it to the brink of collapse. Strangely, it is as if management needs the strike more than workers! Outsourced operations are the biggest cost driver at the SAA, according to the arguments presented by the unions. The SACP is calling upon the SAA management to open up and be transparent about all the cost drivers and the extent to which they are affecting the viability of the airline. In addition, the SACP is calling upon the SAA to disclose the details and costs associated with the aircraft lease and fuel agreement/s, including any "middlepersons" and their cost implications and impact on the viability of the national airline carrier. The SACP identifies itself with good governance, the national imperative for public enterprises to be operated in a sustainable and developmental manner, whilst at the same time dealing with the plight of the workers sensitively and professionally. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_5',113,'0','0']));Therefore, the SACP calls for meaningful consultation to resolve the strike amicably as a matter of urgency.
