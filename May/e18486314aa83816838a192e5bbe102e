SADTU demands an apology from COPE 10 May 2019 The South African Democratic Teachers’ Union (SADTU) is calling on the COPE to apologise for the slanderous remarks they have made about the Union’s involvement in the elections. Speaking to the media today, COPE leader Dennis Bloem accused the ANC of deploying its cadres in voting stations in the form of SADTU/teachers and are running the elections; they mishandled their party agents in voting stations. SADTU rejects this slur against the union. It is disingenuous and mischievous of COPE or any political party to accuse SADTU of any mishaps related to the elections. SADTU was never approached to provide any service to the Independent Electoral Commission ((IEC). Since 1994, teachers and support staff have been appointed to assist in elections to serve the country as citizens and professionals and not on the basis of being SADTU members. We know it is not easy to accept defeat but labelling and defaming SADTU cannot be accepted. COPE knows very well that in the appointment letters that the electoral staff have received, there is no requirement in the name of SADTU. Teachers and support staff serving as IEC electoral officials do so as committed citizens of our country. These citizens serve under difficult and sometimes dangerous situations but they are committed to serve the nation. We cannot allow the name of SADTU to be dragged into the mud when there are laws to resort to when people feel the elections have been tampered with. We call upon COPE to withdraw this slanderous statement and apologise to SADTU and its members with immediate effect or we take them to court. Issued by Nomusa Cembi, Media Officer, SADTU, 10 May 2019
