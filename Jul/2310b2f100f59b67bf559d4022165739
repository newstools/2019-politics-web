Joburg by-elections: DA will continue building a City that works 25 July 2019 After an intense campaign period, the Democratic Alliance (DA) has retained wards 54, 83 and 112 in yesterday’s by-elections. The DA councillors in these wards will continue to work tirelessly with communities to ensure that quality services are delivered. It is regrettable that the African National Congress (ANC) has managed to take hold of another ward in Johannesburg, that of ward 109. We fought a tough campaign but recognise that we have much work ahead of us to turn things around in the metro and the ward. However, we are encouraged that we retained three wards despite challenging circumstances, which we work to address in all that we do. I wish to thank all DA members and activists who worked so hard on these campaigns after an even tougher general election campaign. Only a DA-led government can bring change to the people of Johannesburg. The DA remains steadfast in our commitment to create One South Africa for All.
