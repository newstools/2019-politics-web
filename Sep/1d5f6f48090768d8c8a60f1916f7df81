DA calls on Supra to tell the truth and nothing but the truth 23 September 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) is not surprised to learn that former premier of the North West, Supra Mahumapelo has threatened to speak out against top politicians and business people implicated in alleged criminality “at the right time”. This follows reports in the media over the weekend linking Supra with the assassination of prominent businessman, Wandile Bozwana, in 2015. The truth is not hard to define, but Mahumapelo’s threat to speak out at the right time placed him as someone with the ability and capability to become the key witness and to break the silence on who has killed Bozwana. Supra’s seeming unwillingness to speak out is an outrage and we challenge him to speak the truth and nothing but the truth. By withholding any information that could assist in the arrest of the culprits, Supra is defeating the ends of justice. We will therefore write to the National Prosecuting Authority, requesting them to act against the former premier in terms of Section 34 of the Prevention and Corrupt Activities Act, which clearly states that: “any person who holds a position of authority (defined in section 34(4) of the Act), who knows or ought reasonably to have known or suspected that any other person has committed an offence (of corruption) in terms of sections 3 to 16 or 20 to 21 of the Act or theft, fraud, extortion, forgery or uttering of a forged document involving an amount of R100 000,00 or more, must report such knowledge or suspicion or cause such knowledge or suspicion to be reported to any police official.” We further call on Supra Mahumapelo as a former premier and senior member of the ANC, to stop his threats and empty rhetoric, respect the Constitution and to present himself as the main witness in this case. The people of the North West have a right to know what led to Bozwana’s death and it is in the public’s interest for Supra to speak the truth. If he is indeed innocent, coming forward with the truth is the only way to debunk myths and allegations about his involvement. Issued by Joe McGluwa, DA North West Provincial Leader, 23 September 2019
