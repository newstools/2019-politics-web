Public transport to run as per normal in Tshwane 3 September 2019 Gauteng Public Transport and Roads Infrastructure MEC Jacob Mamabolo has reassured the residents of Tshwane that public transport services will not be interrupted today, 03 September, 2019. The MEC held an early morning meeting together with the South African Police Service (SAPS) led by Brigadier Abbey Nkhwashu, and the Taxi industry led by Mr Piet Mahlangu, Provincial Chairperson of GNTA and Mr Mohlabane Tsebe, Regional Chairperson of SANTACO. The meeting was heldÂ  following threats of a minibus Taxi strike announced last night planned for early this morning. Both Taxi Associations dismissed as unfounded threats of a planned strike by the Taxi industry. They confirmed that Taxi operations were running smoothly and as normal. The Taxi industry leaders however indicated there may be sporadic and isolated incidences of criminal activity and looting that takes place using the name of the Taxi industry by people that are not even known to the industry. They distanced the Taxi industry from such acts and condemned violence of any kind. MEC Mamabolo has assured the residents and commuters of Tshwane that the Mini-bus taxis and transport in general will operate smoothly and the City will be monitored to maintain order and stability, and that any opportunistic and isolated acts of criminal will be dealt with harshly by law enforcement agencies.
