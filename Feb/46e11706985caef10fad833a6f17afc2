Malema charge: NPA’s hesitation is regrettable 7 February 2019 The civil rights organisation AfriForum bemoans the fact that the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) is hesitating to take Julius Malema, Leader of the EFF, to court in order to get some answers regarding his apparent criminal behaviour during the EFF’s five-year celebrations in 2018 when he evidently fired some shots with an object resembling an assault rifle. AfriForum filed criminal charges against Malema shortly after a video clip of the incident started doing the rounds. It appears that the NPA’s hesitation in this matter is being done for the protection of Malema, especially when the national election taking place in May 2019 is taken into consideration. If the NPA maintains its silence, AfriForum will make use of all remedies to its availability in order to send the prosecution in a direction. “With this case the NPA was presented with the opportunity to show the public that they prosecute crimes – notwithstanding the offender’s identity and without any fear and/or preference. Currently however it appears that the mentioned law application authority is choosing to maintain its already distorted image,” says Ian Cameron, AfriForum’s Head of Community Safety. “If the NPA is not able or willing to handle Malema’s prosecution, AfriForum’s Private Prosecution Unit will take over the reins in order to ensure that justice prevails,” concludes Marnus Kamfer, AfriForum’s Legal and Risk Manager.
