DA ready to retain wards in Gauteng by-elections 6 August 2019 The Democratic Allliance (DA) has its sights set on retaining three municipal wards in by-elections in the City of Ekurhuleni and the Rand West City Local Municipality in Gauteng tomorrow. These wards became vacant when councillors were elected to Parliament or the Provincial Legislature in the May Election. The DA stands behind Amanda Davison in ward 15 and Zaakirah Ismail in ward 29 in the City of Ekurhuleni, and Nicolette Claudine Kiewietz in Ward 8 in the Rand West City Local Municipality. The DA urges all voters in these wards to come out in numbers tomorrow, and to vote for the DA who will fight for you and work hard for you in these wards. The DA has a proven track record of strong opposition in ANC municipalities, and a growing track record of delivery wherever it governs. In Midvaal, we have achieved five years of consecutive clean audits, improved the water supply to informal settlements, created more than a 1000 jobs, increased the indigent income threshold to R4000 and assisted in starting 37 Early Childhood Development Centres. In the DA-led City of Johannesburg we have uncovered corruption worth billions, stabilized the cities’ finances, rolled out Opportunity Centres to help residents grow their businesses, extended clinic hours and opened free Community Substance Abuse Treatment Centres. Equally, in the DA-led City of Tshwane we have reduced unauthorized expenditure by over a billion rand, slashed the 900-plus political appointees in the Mayor’s Office, sold the mayoral mansion to build 52 RDP houses and provided residents with more than 16125 job opportunities. Tomorrow, with the help of every voter who wants change in their municipality, we can win and keep the DA fighting for you. Issued by John Moodey, Gauteng Provincial Leader, 6 August 2019
