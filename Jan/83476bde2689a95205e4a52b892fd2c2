WESTERN CAPE GOVERNMENT TO PROACTIVELY EXAMINE BOSASA CONTRACTS 25 November 2018 Premier Helen Zille has issued an instruction for the Western Cape Government to examine existing and past contracts with BOSASA. Premier Zille said: “In light of what is emerging in the Zondo Commission of Inquiry, we are proactively examining contractual relationships with BOSASA. We are a clean government with tight controls and robust anti-corruption measures. We are taking this proactive step to instil public confidence in our commitment to transparency and accountability. I believe all governments, and especially the national government, should be undertaking the same process.” Further details will be announced in due course. “I believe this to be a necessary pro-active step in ensuring that any business conducted with BOSASA and/or its affiliated companies adhered to all stringent control measures; that value was derived for deliverables or services rendered; and to proactively confirm the Western Cape Government’s active anti-corruption stance,” said Zille.
