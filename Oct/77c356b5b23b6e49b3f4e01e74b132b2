State capture net letting too many get away 25 October 2019 The holes in the net that is supposed to catch state capturers are much too big and, thus, the majority of the offenders are getting away. Too much focus is placed on the big offenders, while every single offender, big and small, should be held accountable.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0'])); Yesterday in a parliamentary member’s declaration, the FF Plus welcomed the various measures that President Cyril Ramaphosa implemented to eradicate poor management, state capture and corruption, however, the party also pointed out that the prosecution processes leave much to be desired. In the process of sifting out the guilty parties from the various ANC factions and focusing only on some of the cases, there is no true justice for the people who were the hardest hit by the effects of state capture and corruption, namely, the poorest in the community. The levels of inequality, poverty and unemployment, which were all made much worse by state capture and corruption, must be taken into account when the crimes of politicians, individuals and businessmen are being investigated. That is the true reason for the lack of economic empowerment in South Africa. The people of South Africa's futures were widely and generally expropriated without compensation. The special investigating unit, the special tribunal, the courts, the police and the office of the Public Protector (PP) are underfunded and understaffed and it is derailing justice. Selected high profile cases often get all the attention during investigations, while other complaints are mostly ignored with detrimental consequences for service delivery.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_1',114,'0','0'])); It would probably not be wrong to estimate that in 98% of the cases where public money is squandered and misused, the offenders face absolutely no consequences. It is wrong. ANC has become an acronym for “Absolutely No Consequence”. The executive authority must be held accountable. Investigations aimed at merely pacifying the public will not eradicate the root of the problem. All offenders must respect the law and not only those who come up on the radar due to political reasons.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_3',115,'0','0'])); Issued by Jaco Mulder, FF Plus MP and chief spokesperson: Justice and Correctional Services, 27 October 2019
