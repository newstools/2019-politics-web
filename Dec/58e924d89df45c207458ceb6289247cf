She added once the investigation was concluded, necessary steps would be taken.

He said the circumstances surrounding the incident required an urgent full investigation and that there should be consequences for the "heavy-handedness" which the officials reacted in the situation. "Their aggression was evident not only in their attitude toward Nic Dlamini, but also towards other cyclists on the scene who recorded incident. "No matter what the circumstances, there is no excuse for this kind of reaction," Winde said. The premier added that the incident had revealed the fractured relationship between the cycling community and SANParks and said his office would be establishing a round table discussion in a bid to repair the relationship. "This incident undermines Brand South Africa, at a time where our economy can ill-afford further damage to our brand and our tourism economy."

Donovan le Cok said in a statement that he got to the scene when Dlamini was already off his bike.

Nic was quite upset, he was hurt and his bike was damaged." "At that point there was a heated discussion with the head ranger, Nic wasnâ€™t aggressive towards him, trying to get away or resisting being detained. The guy just laid into, turned him around, and twisted his arm high above his head," Le Cok said.
