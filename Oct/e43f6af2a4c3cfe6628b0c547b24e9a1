NEHAWU statement on the warning of wage-freezing by the Deputy Minister of Finance 10 October 2019 The National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union [NEHAWU] has noted with shock the reckless and inciting proposal of freezing wages of public servant made by the Deputy Minister of Finance earlier in the week. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0'])); It is really disturbing that every time when there are problems in the fiscus workers must face the brunt. Just some few years ago the same department introduced a moratorium on the filling of vacant posts which resulted in a high vacancy rate that we are currently experiencing in the public service. As a result, the same workers that must face salary freezing are doing work of more than three people while remunerated for one position. As if that was not enough the DPSA has instructed departments to cut the percentages of bonuses further dampening the spirits and morale of our members and workers. To us this is not fair because workers are doing their best in ensuring that service is given to the general public but Treasury is not appreciating their efforts but rather are subjecting workers to such nonsensical proposals. NEHAWU will not stand idle while workers are punished for sins not of their making. Our National Executive Committee [NEC] took a decision to pick a fight against Treasury especially its orientation in year 2019. In this regard, a comprehensive plan will be revealed very soon on the steps to be taken in waging a relentless war against Treasury. It would be highly unfair for workers to be subjected to wage-freezing because Eskom has been looted to the ground with no tangible turnaround strategy to pull it out of the doldrums. The looting and normalisation of profit loss is deeply entrenched at Eskom and will require strong leadership, prosecutions of those who are lining their pockets and a sound turn-around strategy to save the SOE from total collapse. Continued bailouts of Eskom in its current form is nothing but throwing money into an endless pit.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0'])); Moreover, workers cannot suffer because the South African Revenue Services [SARS] has failed to achieve the tax collection target of R1 422 trillion. During our national strike in March 2019 we sharply raised the issue of the low staff morale at SARS and how it contributes to the institution failing to fulfil its mandate and reaching its targets. As NEHAWU, will we will vehemently oppose this silly proposal as and when it is presented at the Public Service Coordination Bargaining Council [PSCBC]. The national union will not enter into any discussion that seeks to take away what workers have gallantly fought for and reverse their gains. In this regard, we will mobilise all our members and society at large for a mother of all fights against the austerity measures by treasury.
