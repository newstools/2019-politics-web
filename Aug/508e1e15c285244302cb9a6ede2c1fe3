Law and order breaking down in Lenasia South 7 August 2019 Protests, violence and damage to property has flared up again in Lenasia South as residents of informal settlements protested against the alleged demolition of shacks. A car was set alight and it was fortunate that the occupants were able to escape. In addition, passing vehicles were pelted with stones and it was reported that a train was stopped by the alleged land grabbers by placing burning objects on the tracks. Clearly, SAPS is not geared up to deal with the escalating breakdown in law and order. This follows a meeting held last week between the Mayor of Johannesburg, Herman Mashaba and the Gauteng MEC for Human Settlements, Lebogang Maile where it was agreed that an intergovernmental task team will table a detailed and costed plan by this week. In light of the agreed collaborative approach between the City and Province, it is unclear whether the alleged demolition of shacks on Wednesday was part of the holistic plan or took place in isolation as part of a different process. What is certain is that the rule of law is fragmenting, and that peoples’ lives and property are at risk. The constitutional obligation of the State to protect its citizens is not being met and anarchy is becoming the order of the day. Issued by Alan Fuchs, DA Constituency Lenasia, 7 August 2019
