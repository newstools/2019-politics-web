AfriForum approaches court urgently about unlawful electricity increases 5 July 2019 The civil rights organisation AfriForum served court paper on the Tshwane Metro and Nersa on 4 July 2019 after this municipality had implemented unlawful electricity increases without Nersa’s approval. According to Jaco Grobbelaar, AfriForum’s District Coordinator for Greater Pretoria, the Tshwane Metro maintains that it is the executive authority and may therefore implement the increased tariff without the necessary approval. “According to the law, however, the Tshwane Metro is not authorised to implement the increase, and we will act against this unfairness. Since neither Nersa nor the Tshwane Metro replied to any of AfriForum’s correspondence, we have no other remedy but to approach the court urgently,” Grobbelaar says. In terms of Schedule 14 of the Electricity Regulatory Act (act No 4 of 2006) the municipality may not implement an increased electricity tariff without Nersa’s approval. Grobbelaar also says that many residents have already approached AfriForum because they not only had to pay a basic tariff of R56, but also received less units that the previous month. Residents have also taken to social media to express their concerns over the increase, which also caused great confusion. “It is complete unfair that the Tshwane Metro implement the increase without the approval of Nersa or without informing the public. AfriForum will fight the matter to ensure that justice prevails.” AfriForum encourages residents of Pretoria to sign its petition and support AfriForum in the matter. Click here to sign the petition.
