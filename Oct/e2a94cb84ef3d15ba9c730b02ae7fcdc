The solution to e-Tolls is simple: scrap them now 13 October 2019 A solution to e-Tolls in Gauteng must be found as a matter of urgency. The Minister of Transport Fikile Mbalula announced on Thursday that the deadline for making a pronouncement on e-Tolls has once again been moved.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0'])); Minister Mbalula gave no clear indication as to when this will happen as they need more time to consult with stakeholders. During a question and answer session in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature earlier this month, Premier David Makhura indicated that there is no need for an intergovernmental dispute to be declared. It is clear that the ANC government has absolutely no plans to scrap e-Tolls in Gauteng.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0'])); The DA has always been against the implementation of e-Tolls as it is unfair tax burden on our already overburdened residents. If a small percentage of the fuel levy or even the pipeline supply levy was put towards the project from the start, it could already have been paid off. Instead the fuel levy is being used to bail out mismanaged State Owned Enterprises (SOEs). Also, if the collection contract was not renewed this could have saved Sanral over R600m per year that could have gone towards paying off the e-toll loans.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0'])); If e-Tolls are not scrapped before the year ends, then the e-Toll collection contract which is due to end on 2 December 2019, could be renewed, which we cannot afford. The DA will continue to put pressure on the government to find a way to scrap e-Tolls. Issued by Fred Nel, DA Gauteng Shadow MEC for Roads and Transport, 13 October 2019
