ANC condemns persecution of Klein Akker residents by DA government 27 August 2019 The African National Congress (ANC) urges the DA government of the Western Cape to stop its heartless and inhumane persecution of Klein Akker residents. Hundreds of people, including women, children and the elderly, were rendered homeless and destitute as a result of the inhumane action by the DA government. Evicting people in this harsh weather is a cruel and barbaric act which must be condemned by all South Africans who value human rights and human dignity. We commend our NEC member, Comrade Thoko Didiza, who, in her capacity as Minister of Agriculture, Land Affairs and Rural Development, intervened on the side ot the evicted residents and provided them with interim relief on a state-owned land in Stellenbosch. Determinded to persecute these residents and to crush their dignity further, they again evicted the Klein Akker residents. This blatant abuse and determination to trample on the dignity of the most vulnerable members of society is despicable and abhorrent. The ANC commends the efforts of Cde Thoko.Didza and her Deputy Cde Mcebisi Skwatsha for their interventions. We urge them never to rest nor tire until a solution is found and the residents get justice. The ANC will work with all relevant stakeholders in pursuit of a viable solution. We have directed our structures in the Western Cape to monitor the situation and support the evicted residents in whatever way possible. The ANC is considering reporting the conduct of the Western Cape provincial government to the South African Human Rights Commission for invesigation and consideration of appropriate corrective action.
