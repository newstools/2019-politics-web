I am the very model of a modern cabinet minister -My hands are in the cash-drawer; both the dexter and the sinister - I advance my family members in a manner most avuncularAnd silence all my critics with my statements so debunk-ular! I represent my Party’s views with very great avidity I sit through every session close to comatose morbidity And don’t debate lest I betray my absolute stupidity But always vote as I am told with mindless rash rapidity I’ve a theory of a Third Force I can use when it’s appropriate A list of nice big farms that I would like to see expropriate A secret not-so-little rural kraal where I luxuriate The cost of which gives rise to hordes of enemies infuriate When I review the background to my ministerial history The reason for my failure is an enigmatic mystery I’ve done my best to line my nest through undetected riggery And cheered on our great leader in his parliamentary sniggery My progress was impeded by a dearth of education So I whistled up a doctorate in a mood of exultation Now I think I’ll be suspended midst a cloud of speculation With a salary for life and not a hint of degradation The outcome of my tenure here is plainly a catastrophe Collapse of my portfolio is my undisputed legacy The mess I’ve made has killed our trade and caused investors all to flee  The ruin of the country being the uncontested prophecy!! * With apologies to WS Gilbert.
