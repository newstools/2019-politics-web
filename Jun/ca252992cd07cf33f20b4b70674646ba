Social grant payment unused for more than 03 months will lapse 12 June 2019 South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) would like to encourage social grant beneficiaries to collect the social grant monthly before it lapses. The social grant lapses when beneficiaries fail to claim for a period of three consecutive months. Beneficiary must note that the Agency informs them in a form of letter in advance that the social grant will lapse. Social grants recipients are encouraged to register correct contacts and addresses to avoid missing important communication from SASSA. Beneficiaries have an opportunity to apply for restoration within 90 days from the date of the lapsing. If a beneficiary does not apply for the restoration of the social grant within 90 days of suspension, it can be interpreted as being unclaimed and will lapsed thereafter the beneficiary must make a new application. To apply for the restoration of social grant, application should include the reason for not responding to request for review or the intention to suspend and a completion of the administrative process that determines how the beneficiary managed financially during the suspension. The application for restoration must be supported by a letter from SASSA giving the reason for decision suspension or the lapsing of the grant. Beneficiaries seeking more information should contact our toll free on 0800 60 10 11 from 08:00 – 16:00 during week days Monday – Friday.
