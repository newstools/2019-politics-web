COSATU statement on the meeting with the Special Cabinet Committee that looks into the affairs of Eskom 19 February 2019 The Congress of South African Trade Unions met with the Special Cabinet Committee that looks into the affairs of Eskom, Chaired by Deputy President DD Mabuza, yesterday, to discuss the proposed unbundling of Eskom by the government.  The meeting was also attended by President Cyril Ramaphosa. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss this plan and try to break the existing deadlock between the workers and government over this proposed restructuring/unbundling of the power utility. While we fully support the government’s commitment to fixing the power utility, we remain opposed to any restructuring that will add to decreasing levels of job security and bring about fundamental changes in the delivery of basic services. Our position on this issue is not just one of a narrow interest group, but it is also driven by a wider societal perspective. We remain totally opposed to any restructuring plan that will benefit the capitalist class and increase prices for the working class. The meeting did not succeed in breaking the deadlock between the workers and government but agreed that the process of engagement should continue at both the workplace and political level. Both parties agreed to meet again after the upcoming COSATU Central Executive Committee meeting set for next week. Issued by Sizwe Pamla, National Spokesperson, COSATU, 19 February 2019
