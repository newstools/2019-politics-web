UCT Council decision on the resolution of the Senate regarding formal relationships with Israeli academic institutions in the Occupied Palestinian Territories The University of Cape Town Council, at its meeting on 30 March 2019, considered the resolution of the Senate that "UCT will not enter into any formal relationships with Israeli academic institutions operating in the Occupied Palestinian Territories as well as other Israeli academic institutions enabling gross human rights violations in the Occupied Palestinian Territories". Council did not adopt this resolution of the Senate. It was the View of the Council that a number of issues required clarification, including a full assessment of the sustainability impact of the Senate resolution, and a more consultative process was necessary before the matter could be considered any further. Council resolved to refer the matter back to the Senate. The Council separately resolved to: Reaffirm its commitment to supporting the rights and freedom of all people as universally recognised under international law; Condemn any acts that violate those rights and freedoms; Condemn the atrocities and human rights violations perpetrated in the occupied Palestinian Territories, and elsewhere in the world; Call on all academics and academic institutions to support this resolution; Reaffirm UCT's commitment to academic freedom but reserves the right to dissociate itself from those academics and academic institutions that support (directly or indirectly) the violation of human rights and/or enable the violation of human rights.
