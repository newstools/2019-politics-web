Statistics paint a shocking picture of the extent of the countryâ€™s drought crisis 14 November 2019 The shocking extent and consequences of the long drought in South Africa are clearly evident in the statistics that show that the country's milk farmers have decreased from 3561 in January 2009 to a mere 1228 at present. It means that more than 2300 milk farmers had to throw in the towel primarily due to the drought. With regard to agriculture in general, approximately 30 000 job opportunities were lost since January last year. According to media reports, more than 37% of the rural population is seriously affected by the drought, while the country's extensive game and hunting industry, which attracts great numbers of foreign tourists, had to cut back on their wildlife numbers with 80%. While these figures leave no room for doubt in our minds that the country's farmers are fighting for survival and to ensure food security for South Africa, the government seems unwilling to help them in this time of crisis. The government's advice to farmers is to take out insurance against losses caused by drought. It is shocking. The government must wake up before it is too late. This crisis will not vanish overnight. Thus, the FF Plus requests the government to also discuss this problem in the National Council of Provinces so as to look for urgent solutions to save farmers and their employees from ruin.
