#ScrapETollsNow: ANC-led government not serious about scrapping e-tolls 13 June 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng notes the comments made by the Minister of Transport, Fikile Mbalula about the possible scrapping of e-Tolls. While this is a step in the right direction, this is not the first time that the ANC-led government has hinted that e-tolls will be scrapped. Just before the general elections the ANC said e-tolls would be gone by May. It is now June and yet e-Tolls are still here.  From the onset, the DA has been against the implementation of e-Tolls, as it is an unfair financial burden to the residents of Gauteng. Earlier this year, the South African National Roads Agency (SANRAL) said they will no longer be issuing summonses for outstanding e-toll debt. If the Minister of Transport is serious about scrapping e-Tolls he needs to give us a clear timeline as to when this will happen. It is clear that this system is not working and needs to be scrapped. I will be tabling questions in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature to ascertain what the plan is to deal with e-Tolls. Issued by Fred Nel, DA Shadow MEC for Roads and Transport, 13 June 2019
