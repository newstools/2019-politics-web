Baby stolen at Bara Hospital 7 June 2019 I am horrified by the kidnapping of a new-born baby at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital yesterday afternoon. A female suspect was spotted on the CCTV cameras wearing blue jeans, flip-flops and a long-sleeve white top. This is a particularly heinous crime and I hope that the police are successful in finding the suspect speedily and rescuing the baby. This incident is hugely distressing and highlights the need to tighten up on security at all maternity wards as baby snatching has happened at other hospitals as well.
