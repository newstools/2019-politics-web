We extend our heartfelt condolences to his family, loved ones and our fellow South Africans as we mourn the passing of this great man. Turok dedicated his life to equality as well as the freedom and liberation of the South African people at a time when it would have been easier for him to remain silent. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));He served his country with humility and principle and always spoke truth to power, whether is was during the oppressive apartheid era or our new democratic dispensation - he was fearless in his pursuit to ensure that South Africa was a better place for all who live in it. As an activist, professor and member of Parliament, Turok‘s commitment to a fair and equal South Africa should serve as a example to all of us. A giant has indeed fallen and we will never forget his sacrifices, steadfastness and fearless independence. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));Death be not proud. Rest in eternal peace, Ben Turok. Issued by John Steenhuisen, DA Leader, 9 December 2019
