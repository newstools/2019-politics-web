DA welcomes expanded SIU investigation into Life Esidimeni 17 January 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes President Cyril Ramaphosa’s proclamation to broaden the terms of reference of the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) investigation into the Gauteng Health Department’s Life Healthcare Esidimeni contract and 28 entities where mental health patients were sent. I am concerned, however, that we could have endless investigation instead of prosecutions that convict guilty people in court. We need to know how the SIU is coordinating with the police investigation which is slow and under-resourced. Proper expertise and resources are needed to ensure a speedy conclusion to investigations so that all those implicated in the Esidimeni tragedy are punished. Meanwhile, Gauteng Premier David Makhura should take legal steps to force former Gauteng Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu and former senior health officials to pay from their own money the multi-million rand compensation payout to Esidimeni victims. According to the Apportionment of Damages Act, a party that has been found liable in a civil claim, and has paid this claim in full, can act to recover from those who were also allegedly liable to recover a contribution for their fair share of what has been paid. I have repeatedly asked Makhura to do this, but it seems that he is still protecting Mahlangu in this matter. Justice must prevail, and those who have blood on their hands must be held accountable.
