Our children are not political pawns 15 January 2019 Apparently, the latest pawns used by the ANC and other political opportunists are the teachers and learners of the Stilfontein High School in the North West province. The school is being accused of racism and discrimination after some learners were promoted to the next grade while others were not. On Friday, rioters demonstrated their dissatisfaction by protesting in front of the school and yesterday, the situation got completely out of hand when bricks where thrown through windows and a parent allegedly assaulted a teacher. There were various ANC members as well as members of other organisations among the rioters. The FF Plus strongly condemns this kind of behaviour. The North West Department of Education has already had numerous meetings with the school and other stakeholders and the Department has also launched an investigation as is required by the relevant legislation. It is unacceptable that rioters are incited to violence so that the ANC can score cheap political points by means of racial rhetoric just before the general elections. Parents and learners must afford the Department the opportunity to complete its investigation and not break down the school just because the ruling party has irresponsibly incited them to do so. The FF Plus will remind the MEC for Education, Sello Lehari, of the Department's duty to ensure the safety of learners and teachers at schools as determined by the Schools Act. The Department must also ensure that offenders who vandalise school property or who are guilty of any crimes, like assault and intimidation, are duly prosecuted.
