KZN government can no longer pay lip service to N3 truck violence 5 September 2019 Our country is facing a crisis – one which is plunging our economy down a path of no return. At the same time, we are also facing an unemployment rate of 29% with the sad reality that most unemployed South Africans will never find proper jobs. The crisis I am specifically referring to today is that of ongoing truck violence along the critical N3 route, targeting foreign nationals in particular who are risking their lives everyday transporting goods from one point to the next. They are overworked, and fear for their lives while just doing their jobs to put food on their table for their families. Regrettably, the standard operating procedure of this ANC-led government has always been reactionary rather than proactive. The reason why so many drivers have died in the hands of criminals is largely because of the lip service that this government – words that no longer mean anything. The N3 and N2 corridors are one of the most important economic drivers for our provincial and national economy.  It supports the movement of goods from our ports to the rest of Africa. The DA has already provided solutions to KZN’s Transport MEC which include increasing law enforcement to 24 hours and the rooting out of unroadworthy vehicles and unlicensed drivers. There is also no reason why, immigration checks cannot be done at every toll station. The implementation of active law enforcement will give people in our province a sense of confidence that government is enforcing immigration laws. This would hopefully prevent people from taking the law into their own hands and attacking foreign national drivers. It is time to bring back the political will to fix our province and the DA sincerely hopes that this debate is not just another ‘talk shop’ and that interventions will be made going forward.
