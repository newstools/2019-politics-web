AfriForum and Tshwane Metro reach consensus on tariff increase 17 July 2019 AfriForum and the Tshwane Metro have met and pledged to work together to ensure consensus for both parties regarding the implementation of the 2019/2020 electricity tariff increases. As part of the agreement both parties undertook the following: - Both parties will conduct quarterly meetings so there’s clear lines of communication pertaining the matter. - Residents will be charge according to the 2018/2019 tariffs as approved by Nersa. - Tshwane Metro will credit prepaid users with units that had to pay the increased tariff. - Both parties await Nersa’s approval of the 2019/2020 tariff increase to be implemented. Having agreed on these terms, AfriForum will no longer pursue the court action against the Metro that sought to halt the proposed tariff increase. This will result in a more conducive environment for engagement with the Metro. According to Morné Mostert, AfriForum’s Head of Local Government Affairs, this was a positive meeting and he hopes that it can lead to good cooperation in the future. “AfriForum is always open to work with the Metro to ensure that the rights of our members are protected. We hope that in future we can solve these issues before we reach a point where we have to approach the courts.” The deliberations with AfriForum are an indication that at the end of any disagreement is an acknowledgement that all communities are part of one Tshwane comprised of responsible citizens and partners!
