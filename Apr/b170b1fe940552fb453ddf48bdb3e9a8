Ace Magashule supporters who disrupted book launch are undermining democracy 10 April 2019 The FF Plus condemns the behaviour of protesters at the book launch of Pieter-Louis Myburgh's book entitled Gangster State about the ANC secretary-general, Ace Magashule, and views it as the undermining of freedom of speech and, thus, also democracy. The FF Plus insists that the police must speedily investigate the incident and that the people who are responsible for damaging books must be arrested so as to send a loud and clear message that such behaviour will not be tolerated. The police must also say why they allowed the protesters to disrupt the launch and damage property. Myburgh himself said that one got the impression that the protesters told the police what to do. The ANC did condemn the incident, but if the ANC, its office-bearers and supporters really endorse a government that is accountable, then they would insist that the serious allegations made in the book, which even include murder, are thoroughly investigated. The incident serves as proof that the example set by Members of Parliament, of being undisciplined and having a tendency to become violent when they are unhappy about something, is instrumental to such behaviour. If Members of Parliament set such an example, members of the public are bound to follow it. South Africa is a constitutional state and so Magashule is free to approach the court if he is intent on taking his claim that Myburgh's book is so-called fake news that slanders him, further.
