Bathabile Dlamini still has a case to answer for, despite Public Protector exoneration 2 October 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) notes the release of the Public Protector’s report today in which she exonerates former Minister of Social Development, Bathabile Dlamini, from willfully misleading Parliament. In 2017, the DA referred the former Minister to the Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, on the allegation that she stated that SASSA would be ready to institutionalise the distribution of social grants come 1st April 2017, when less than a year later, SASSA officials informed Parliament’s Social Development Committee that SASSA had failed to procure an alternative service provider. Despite the outcomes of this report, the DA still holds the view that Bathabile Dlamini must be held to account for putting the livelihoods of millions of South Africans at risk and plunging the country to the brink of a complete crisis. She indeed has a host of implications to answer for: - 3 October 2018 – Charges of perjury against former Minister Bathabile Dlamini at the Johannesburg Central Police Station; - 14 June 2019 - Criminal charges against the former Minister at the Cape Town Central Police Station after she claimed that she was aware of wives of ANC members who were allegedly involved in dubious relationships with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS); and, - Dlamini is notoriously loath to appear before Parliament, whether it be oral question sessions or committee meetings, with the Portfolio Committee on Social Development having to consider issuing a summons to have her appear. Dlamini failed dismally in her role at the head of Social Development as well as the women of South Africa and she must have her day in Court. We will be studying the contents of the report and consult with our lawyers on the merits thereof. Issued by Bridget Masango, DA Shadow Minister of Social Development, 2 October 2019
