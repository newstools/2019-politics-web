Statement on the report of the Public Protector into allegations against President Ramaphosa 19 July 2019 The Presidency has today, Friday 19 July 2019, received the report of the Public Protector on an investigation into allegations of a violation of the Executive Ethics Code by President Cyril Ramaphosa. This follows the receipt by the President on 30 May 2019 of a Section 7(9) notice, in which the Public Protector outlined her preliminary findings. On 27 June 2019, the President submitted a substantial response to the Section 7(9) notice dealing in detail with areas where the preliminary findings were deficient both factually and in law. It is unfortunate, however, that from a cursory reading of the final report, it seems that the President’s response to the Section 7(9) notice has not been given due consideration. Nonetheless, the President will study the Public Protector’s report and make a decision on any further action. President Ramaphosa wishes to reaffirm his respect for the Office of the Public Protector and his appreciation of the essential role it needs to play in promoting accountability and advancing the interests of the South African people. The President further reaffirms his determination and commitment to fight all forms of corruption and malfeasance. To this end, no person regardless of the position they hold is above law.
