Following allegations of fabricated evidence, my attorneys have demanded that bowmans hand over the tapes of witness interviews 20 August 2019 My attorneys have written to Bowmans, and the City Manager, to demand that they hand over witness tapes so my attorneys can verify the contents of the Bowmans Report as it relates to me. On Friday 2nd August 2019 the Cape Times reported (“Whitehead gives City Two Weeks to rescind report” ) that attorneys acting for suspended City of Cape Town Executive Director, Melissa Whitehead, had discovered evidence of Bowmans fabricating witness statements. These allegations have been submitted to the Legal Practice Council, the professional body that manages the conduct of legal practitioners in South Africa. My name was also mentioned in one of the Bowmans reports, but I have always maintained the report draws inferences and reaches conclusions that are not supported by any evidence. Based on the report of allegations of fabricated evidence, I instructed my attorneys to investigate these claims. My attorneys requested a copy of the complaint to the Legal Practice Council and the allegations contained in it are damning. The allegations are that Whitehead’s attorneys discovered fabricated witness statements, and also that the City’s CFO, Kevin Jacoby, was provided with the transcripts of other witnesses’ evidence prior to, and in preparation for, giving his own evidence in disciplinary hearings. My attorneys will advise me on my rights and on appropriate action, which may include a damages claim, once they have reviewed the tapes.
