MEC Lesufi must stop SADTU’s pickets from disrupting schooling 7 October 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) has learnt that the South African Democratic Teachers’ Union (SADTU) Gauteng Central Region has planned two pickets with the intention of disrupting schooling in that region.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0'])); The pickets will be held on 11 and 14 October at the Gauteng Department of Education (GDE) Gauteng Central Region District offices and the GDE Head Office. The SADTU affiliated members in the Gauteng Central Region have also planned not to submit learners’ marks and reports. SADTU does not prioritise learners interest on top of their agenda. It is unacceptable that learners must suffer because of a dispute between the union and the department.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0'])); SADTU is destroying the future of our children in the townships. Many schools are closed down because of SADTU. Gauteng Central Region is the worst performing region in the province and SADTU must be held accountable for the poor performance of the learners. Teachers are gambling with the future of our children as they are no longer committed to their core mandate of teaching, but instead are prioritising SADTU’s pickets during working hours.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2',114,'0','0'])); Gauteng Education MEC, Panyaza Lesufi must ensure that the SADTU’s planned picket must not continue as planned because it will disrupt learning and teaching in the Gauteng Central Region. The DA believes that the GDE has the responsibility to ensure that learners’ rights are protected at all times. In this case, learning and teaching must take place without further disruption, particularly in township schools.
