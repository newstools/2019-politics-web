HSRC voter satisfaction survey shows high level of confidence, trust in elections 16 May 2019 Voters were generally highly satisfied with their voting experience in the 2019 National and Provincial Elections and overwhelmingly believed the election procedures to be free and fair. This is according to the results of the Election Satisfaction Survey conducted on Election Day 8 May 2019 by the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC). The survey was conducted at a sample of 300 voting stations countrywide selected to be nationally representative. At each voting station 50 voters were interviewed across four different time slots to ensure a fair reflection of the different conditions during the day. The findings of the survey showed that: 97 percent of voters expressed satisfaction in the secrecy of their vote; 95 percent believed that the election procedures were free and fair; 96 percent expressed general satisfaction with the quality of services; rendered by election officials; 96 percent expressed satisfaction with safety and security at voting stations; 95 percent were satisfied with the ballots papers and found it easy to find their party of choice; and 84 percent were confident or completely confident that their vote would be accurately counted. In terms of overall confidence in the Electoral Commission, 92 percent of voters indicated that they trust or strongly trust the Electoral Commission in general. The results are generally in line with the findings in both the 2014 and 2016 elections. Encouragingly, the number of voters who said they were very satisfied with the secrecy of the vote grew from 62 percent in 2016 to 68.5 percent in 2019. In terms of political party tolerance, 64 percent of voters said parties were “very tolerant” of one another and 21 percent said they were “somewhat tolerant”. This is a slight increase over 2016 (61 percent very tolerant and 21 percent somewhat tolerant). In terms of accessibility, the survey found that 68 percent of voters took less than 15 minutes to reach their voting stations (64 percent in 2016) with 22 percent taking between 16-30 minutes (23 percent in 2016), 7 percent taking between 31-60 minutes (8 percent in 2016) and 3 percent more than an hour (same in 2016). On average voters waited 16 minutes to vote (17 minutes in 2016 and 16 minutes in 2014). In its report the HSRC said that based on the 13 750 interviews conducted on Election Day it found that the public was overwhelmingly confident that the elections were free and fair. “These voters evaluations point firmly to the continued integrity of elections in the country,” the HSRC said. The final report of the 2019 National and Provincial Elections Satisfaction Survey is attached. Issued by Kate Bapela on behalf of IEC, 16 May 2019
