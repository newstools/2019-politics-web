Minister Albert Fritz statement on attack on Members of the Anti-Gang Unit 12 June 2019 It is with great concern that I received news this morning that 6 members of our Anti-Gang Unit were attacked and injured in the early hours of this morning while on duty in Samora Machel. I wish to extend my sincere gratitude to our Anti-Gang, all other SAPS units as well as our Municipal Police who serve with total commitment and bravery under the most trying conditions. At the same time I condemn in the strongest possible terms this attack by nameless individuals who are intent on trying to create conditions where their criminality and murderous activities become the norm. We shall not allow this to happen. Our support for the entire Provincial Police, from the Provincial Commissioner to the officers who patrol the streets in noble and sincere efforts to create safer communities is unconditional. We stand with them I wish a speedy recovery to the brave Anti-Gang Unit members and pledge my support in their efforts towards making our communities safer.
