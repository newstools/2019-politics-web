Violence: Urgent plan of action needed 4 September 2019 Agri SA strongly condemns the violence taking place across the country. The degree of media coverage shows South Africa and the world that the country has an enormous crime problem. It cannot be wished away or not spoken about; a clear plan of action from the President's Office is urgently needed. The latest attacks on trucks and major access routes have a direct impact on the agricultural sector because inputs, perishables and other products are not delivered on time or do not reach their destination. This contributes to major losses in a country where food security is of the utmost importance. Agri SA warns producers to plan routes in advance and be on their guard. "These attacks can deter investors to the detriment of the whole of South Africa," says Tommie Esterhuyse, chair of Agri SA’s Centre of Excellence: Rural Safety. “Economic investment is needed to put the country on a growth path. Safety in rural as well as urban areas is a prerequisite for food security, job creation and prosperity, which supports the objectives of the National Development Plan." Agri SA works closely with the South African Police Service and has made policing policy proposals. The Agri Securitas Trust Fund recently donated more than R1.5 million to support safety measures in rural areas. "We also condemn violent crime in general," says Omri van Zyl, Executive Director of Agri SA. "We support civil society who are concerned about the safety of our citizens." Agri SA takes note of various government departments' proposed plans to address the spate of violence. Agri SA will participate in the process of finding solutions for a safe South Africa.
