He gets along with a lot of people. President Zuma had a lot of relationship[s] with a lot of people and I was one of them." When asked about his relationship with the Gupta family, prior to his move to GCIS in February 2011, Manyi said there was no relationship, however, he had known about them.

"The questions here is that Brent Simons comes here and says Mr Chabane says 1, 2, 3, 4. What's that got to do with me, chair?" Manyi asked. Simons previously told the commission that Chabane had indicated to him at the time that Zuma had instructed him to get rid of Themba Maseko as GCIS chief executive even though he, Chabane, was not keen on doing it. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_3',115,'0','0']));"There are members of staff that he had spoken to, there are members of staff that were present when that telephone call came," he said at the time. Simons also said Chabane was not supportive of the appointment of Manyi to GCIS, as per Zuma's instructions. He said Manyi had been embroiled in a scandal over the sourcing of funds for a private venture, and Chabane did not want someone who was going to be in the news. The hearing continues. News24
