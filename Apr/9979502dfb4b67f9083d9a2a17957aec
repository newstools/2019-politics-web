Education MEC hands over old schools in desperate electioneering stunt 25 April 2019 Education MEC, Sibusiso Malaza recently opened two supposedly ‘new’ schools in Mpumalanga, one being Mpisane Primary School in Bushbuckridge and the other, Mgobaneni Primary School in Mbombela. Both schools were presented as new schools but have actually been up and running for several years. In 2016, MEC Malaza’s predecessor, Reginah Mhaule, stated during a press conference that Mgobaneni Primary school would be handed over to the community soon, but in typical ANC fashion, the “soon” was a matter of three years. According to the Department of Education’s 2017/18 infrastructure budget, both schools were to receive a shelter in the assembly area at the cost of R145 000 each. So MEC Malaza’s fanfare was simply to open assembly shelters at existing schools. If MEC Malaza really cared about delivering quality schools and not simply electioneering, he would have used the money spend on the handovers of these schools to ensure that the schools have enough security systems in place. The recent break in at Mpisane Primary School is proof enough that these schools need security and not more empty promises from the failing ANC led government. School infrastructure is a huge problem across the province as many schools still don’t have safe sanitation facilities or even classrooms. For the MEC to focus all his energy on opening old schools instead of building actual schools to alleviate school overcrowding shows that he is not interested in enabling Mpumalanga learners to access quality education that will set them up for bright futures. The DA will continue to monitor the situation until every learner can be guaranteed a good education in a safe space that is conducive to learning. We are committed to building One South Africa for ALL, where no learner is left behind. Issued by Jane Sithole, DA Mpumalanga Premier Candidate, 25 April 2019
