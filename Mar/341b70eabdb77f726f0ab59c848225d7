Premier Ntombela, withholding crucial information undermines the work of the Zondo Commission 26 March 2019 The Democratic Alliance in the Free State has written to the acting secretary of the Zondo Commission, Peter Pedlar requesting him to invoke Rules 10.1 and 10.2 which entitles the Commission to summon any person to produce a document in his or her possession or under his or her control which has a bearing on the matter being investigated. The DA notes with grave concern that the Free State Premier Sisi Ntombela is neck-deep in her mission to frustrate the work of the Zondo Commission into state capture by failing to provide crucial information to former MEC Mxolisi Dlungwana who is expected to give testimony on April 5. Ntombela is seemingly protecting her corrupt comrades by withholding information which may possibly implicate them in state capture. It is clear that Premier Ntombela doesn’t respect the rule of law and is unwilling to cooperate with the law enforcement agencies. To date, the Zondo Commission has revealed explosive evidence of wrongdoing, fraud and corruption in the public sector. The high-ranking politicians, past and present ministers and executives of the parastatals must come forward and cooperate with the Zondo Commission to get the bottom of the extent of the state capture. Allegations of state capture should be something of serious concern to all of us and therefore Premier Ntombela must give the information that will lead to the prosecution of all those who were involved. The DA strongly believes that the work of the commission must be finished expeditiously and this will take people coming forward to give sufficient evidence.
