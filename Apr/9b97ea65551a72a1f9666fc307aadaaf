Public protector must release a report of the investigation of R61m KZN mobile clinic tender 4 April 2019 The IFP demands answers from the Public Protector, Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane on why she has not released the report into the investigation of a R61 million KZN mobile clinic tender. Case Number: (ZNB 9281/2012-H MOBILE HOSPITAL: KZN). We are very perturbed about this delay by the Public Protector because her office released reports on a number of investigations that it has conducted but the report on this issue was not mentioned. Again, when the Public Protector delivering quarterly reports on concluded investigations in June 2018 we had high hopes that the Public Protector will provide clarity on what progress has been made in this matter but she failed to give any progress about it. In my letter to the Public Protector, dated 1st February 2017, and to her predecessor, Advocate Thuli Madonsela dated 19th June 2015 and 4th October 2016 I raised my concerns regarding this controversial tender and requested the Public Protector’s office to investigate but no progress has been reported in this matter since then. This R61million tender saw the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Health lease mobile clinic units from two different companies viz Mzansi Lifecare and Mobile Satellite Technologies. It is high time now for the Public Protector to release this report. We need answers no lame excuses. Time for complacency is over.
