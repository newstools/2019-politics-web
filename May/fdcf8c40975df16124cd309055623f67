First address by Premier Alan Winde upon his inauguration 22 May 2019 It is a great honour and privilege to have been sworn in as Premier of the Western Cape today by Judge President Mr John Hlope. This is a day we have worked long and hard for, and I would like to say thank you to every single voter, and to my party, the Democratic Alliance, for the confidence and trust they have placed in me to lead the provincial government for the next five years. I would also like to thank my family for their unending and unwavering support on this journey. In our election manifesto, we made pledges to the residents of the Western Cape. These include a focus on the economy and jobs, ensuring that we make this a safer province and fixing public transport. That means we have a lot of work to do, and it is time to get to work. Tomorrow, I will be announcing the Cabinet team that will undertake this journey with me, but I also hope to work in a constructive manner with the opposition in the Western Cape, to ensure we do justice to our role as members of the provincial legislature representing the people of the province. My undertaking is to lead this province in the interests of all, so that we make a tangible difference to peopleâ€™s lives. It is our duty and responsibility to ensure that this is a better province tomorrow, than it is today. Issued by Marcellino Martin, Spokesperson to the Premier, 22 May 2019
