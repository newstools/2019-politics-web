The ANC is wrong – they do want to take South Africans’ pensions and homes 23 January 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) notes that the ANC has lodged a complaint with the IEC regarding an advertisement the Party published in a KwaZulu-Natal newspaper and flyers that have been distributed stating that the governing party wants to take citizens’ houses and pension funds. The ANC’s claim that the DA is spreading “disinformation, fake news and fear mongering” cannot be further from the truth. The reality is that the ANC is attempting to take away citizens’ homes and pensions. This was evident when the ANC, along with their policy unit, the EFF, pushed through the amendment of Section 25 of the Constitution, to allow for land expropriation without compensation.  This would make government the sole owner of all property and land, and citizens would have to rent their homes and land from government for life. Furthermore, in its manifesto the ANC unreservedly states its intention to change the South African Reserve Bank’s (SARB) mandate as well as to prescribe to financial institutions where they must invest the money they hold in trust on behalf of pension and retirement fund contributors. Due to their chronic failure in government, the ANC now wants to take the hard-earned pensions of ordinary South Africans to rescue sinking state-owned entities (SOE). The ANC is wrong, the only ones who are using apartheid-style tactics are, in fact, the ANC themselves. Prescribed assets are exactly what the National Party resorted to in desperation when they could not raise capital in the international markets. The ANC’s complaints are thus baseless and we fully encourage and welcome an IEC probe. Issued by Solly Malatsi, DA National Spokesperson, 23 January 2019
