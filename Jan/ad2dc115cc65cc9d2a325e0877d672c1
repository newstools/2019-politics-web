SADTU North West condemns acts of alleged racism at Schweizer-Reneke Laerskool 11 January 2019 SADTU North West is highly disturbed and perplexed by allegations of racism in Schweizer Reneke Laerskool as depicted on the pictures that went viral on social media. It is our firm view that schools through its educations ethos have the role to instil values of respect, dignity, equality and tolerance for our learners. The Union cannot be silent when there is a gross violation of rights of learners to receive equal treatment and education. Acts or practice of racism have no place in our society and cannot be tolerated 24 years into our democracy. We welcome and applaud the manner in which the Department of Education and Sport Development has moved swiftly on the matter to put the educator on precautionary suspension and setting up a team that will further investigate these allegations. We are calling on the Department of Education and Sport Development in the Province to extensively investigate these allegations and leave no stone unturned. We further demand that the investigation should be extended to other parts of the Province so that, once and for all, we root out any form of racism/discrimination wherever it raises its ugly head.
