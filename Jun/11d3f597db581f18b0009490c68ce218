Eskom welcomes court decision on Trillian matter 21 June 2019 The Eskom Board has welcomed the judgement handed down by the Pretoria High Court this week where Trillian is required to pay back all the moneys they received from Eskom between August 2016 and February 2017 in the absence of valid contracts and, in some cases, where no work was done. The amount close to R600million is due, together with interest calculated from the day of judgement, to the date of payment. Trillian is further required to pay for the costs of the application including costs of three counsel. Chairman of the Eskom Board Jabu Mabuza says, “We welcome the judgement and look forward to receiving the money from Trillian. In addition, we urge all corporates who conducted business with Eskom illegally to come forward voluntarily so we can start the process of getting funds that were paid in the course of those assignments. Our resolve, together with management, to recover all ill-gotten gains from the period of what has become known as state capture at Eskom will persist until all moneys due to Eskom have been recovered.” Eskom initiated legal action to recover unlawful payments made to Trillian in 2018, following a long-drawn process from 2017 when Eskom first served Trillian with a letter of demand that was later inexplicably withdrawn by previous management. Eskom continues to work closely with and provide all the support to the law enforcement authorities; the National Treasury, Special Investigative Unit (SIU), South African Police Service (SAPS), Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks), National Directorate of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) and the Zondo Commission on State Capture in order to recover stolen funds using criminal and civil processes.
