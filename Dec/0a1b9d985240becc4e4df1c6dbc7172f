South Africa is Worth Saving 17 December 2019 Inequality, poverty, corruption, unemployment and State Capture – as we near the end of a year that has highlighted everything that is wrong with South Africa,  over the past two weeks the thousands of submissions received through The People’s Dialogue have reminded my why South African is worth saving.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_4',112,'0','0'])); Their message has been clear; we must put divisive politics aside and work together to build a shared future for all South Africans. That is why today I have launched a video (https://youtu.be/c0VRDuXzUng) challenging our people to record their own videos in which they share what they love most about our Country under the hashtag #SASpeaks. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_5',113,'0','0'])); The past two weeks have affirmed to me that South Africans are good people who simply want to live in a Country that works. We are tired of the negativity that constantly confronts us, and the way that our political system does not serve us as the people of South Africa. Indeed, despite all the negativity we face on a daily basis I have been overwhelmed by the level of engagement on our online platform, with ordinary South Africans offering real solutions to our greatest challenges. Our nation’s greatest assets are certainly its people. With this in mind, and as we approach the festive season, I have come to believe that before we can talk further about what needs to be done to fix our Country, we must celebrate everything that we love about South Africa.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_6',114,'0','0'])); Let us be inspired by our love for South Africa and share a message of hope for a better tomorrow this festive season. Ultimately, it is only if we know why our Country is worth saving that we will be motivated to engage in finding solutions to serious challenges such as economic growth, job creation, crime, corruption and illegal immigration. When we return in January, we must be inspired by our love and commitment for South Africa, and its future, as we take the Dialogue further.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_7',115,'0','0'])); Statement issued by Herman Mashaba, Founder, The People’s Dialogue, 17 December 2019
