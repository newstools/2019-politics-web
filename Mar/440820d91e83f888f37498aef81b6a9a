ANC WELCOMES THE INTERVENTION ON THE FINANCIAL CHALLENGES FACED BY THE STUDENTS IN UNIVERSITIES 25 March 2019 The African National Congress (ANC) welcomes the intervention by the ANC-led government to address the challenges facing students in the institutions of higher learning. The ANC is encouraged by the announcement made by Minister of Higher Education, Naledi Pandor that more than 50 000 govemment-funded university students are set to get debt relief. This move is a step in the right direction in dealing with the plight of many students in our institutions of higher leaming. Now, students will be able to focus on their studies after the ANC-led governrnent committed almost R Ibn to settle their outstanding fees in the institutions of higher leaming. This money will settle historic debts for 52 514 NSFAS-funded students currently studying. The ANC is pleased that the Minister had allocated this fund to settle the debts of continuing National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS)-funded students. We commend her for this progressive move. The ANC believes that this swift response from Minister Pandor to deal with historic debt owed to universities by students will also bring stability in universities across the country. The ANC has made education an apex priority in the country which will assist us to address the triple challenge of poverty, inequality and unemployment. The ANC understands that investment in education will assist our country to achieve all our socio-economic development goals. As a country we need different forms of skills in all sectors in order to be able to address economic challenges. The ANC remains committed to free education. We are pleased with the government's efforts to assist students who find themselves unable to study due to financial difficulties.
