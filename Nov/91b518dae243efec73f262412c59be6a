The ANC government directly responsible for rural insecurity 25 November 2019 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_5',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the North West is outraged by the murder of the elderly Schalk van der Merwe at his farm, Leeufontein near Wolmaransstad, late yesterday afternoon. According to reports, the farmer and his wife, Lettie van der Merwe, were overpowered by three men and two women who visited the farm under the pretense of buying sheep from the couple. Schalk was killed in the kraal while Lettie was taken home to unlock the safe, where she was badly assaulted. She is currently in a critical condition in hospital. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_4',113,'0','0']));This devastating incident leaves yet another community, another family and another couple traumatized and terrified; a trauma that cannot be soothed by any number of words. It remains shocking that the ANC government is standing by whilst farmers are being brutally attacked and murdered and yet refuse to declare farm murders as a priority crime. In order to prevent more farmers from leaving the agricultural sector, we must prioritize their safety and thereby ensure that food security is not further threatened. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_6',114,'0','0']));Rural communities have become easy prey for violent crime due to SAPS’ failure to ensure that police officers are knowledgeable, well-trained officers. In light of this, we commend the farm watch response groups who responded immediately and assisted the family in their hour of need. These groups have taken on the role of the SAPS and have become indispensable for rural communities. For this reason, the DA recently announced a R1 billion security plan for the Western Cape and it is time for the ANC government to follow suit and make funds available for this purpose. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_7',115,'0','0']));We therefore once again call on the ANC government to set up rural safety units in order to take urgent action against farm attacks. In our role as opposition party, the DA will continue to put pressure on the ANC government to protect rural communities, farmers and farm workers.
