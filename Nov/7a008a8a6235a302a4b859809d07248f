AfriForum to represent the family of Senzo Meyiwa 5 November 2019 AfriForum and the family of the late soccer player Senzo Meyiwa announced during a media conference today that the civil rights organisation would be representing the Meyiwa family. Adv. Gerrie Nel, Head of AfriForum’s Private Prosecution Unit, has been appointed as the Meyiwa family’s advocate in the murder investigation into the death of Senzo. This follows the fatal shooting of the 27-year-old former Bafana Bafana captain five years ago in a house in Vosloorus, after which the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) failed to institute prosecution. “It is important that AfriForum gets involved in cases such as these – it’s in the interest of the whole country that the criminal justice system functions properly. AfriForum serves as a counterweight to the failure of the state, and as a civil rights watchdog it is our duty to prevent the criminal justice system from collapsing,” says Kallie Kriel, CEO of AfriForum. “The Meyiwa family approached AfriForum for assistance in solving the murder of our beloved Senzo Meyiwa. We, together with AfriForum, want to honour Senzo by ensuring that justice is served, and his murderers are brought to book. The Meyiwa family are proud to be associated with an organisation that is bold enough to stand with us in the fight for justice in this case. We are therefore calling on all reasonable South Africans of all races to stand with us and oppose this injustice,” says Sifiso Meyiwa, the brother of Senzo Meyiwa.
