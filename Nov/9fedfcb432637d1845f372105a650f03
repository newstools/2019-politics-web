BLF will not appeal decision of biased, hostile Electoral Court Today our movement received notice from the Electoral Court in Bloemfontein that leave to appeal the deregistration of our movement has been denied. Black First Land First (BLF) has been deregistered by the Electoral Commission of South Africa (ECSA) on the demand of the racist extreme right-wing organization called Freedom Front Plus (FF+). We expected this outcome. BLF will be holding a Special Policy Conference on the 30th of November this year in Durban to chart the way forward. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_5',112,'0','0']));The Electoral Court, just like most of the other courts having judicial authority in South Africa (SA), has been openly hostile and biased against BLF. Our movement has lost all trust in the entire justice system of this country. We shall not be subjecting ourselves to the kangaroo courts of white supremacy any further. We won’t appeal the decision of the Electoral Court. BLF is aware that the entire white establishment is terrified of the black agenda that we represent. Land thieves and white monopoly capital (WMC) are doing everything to keep BLF out of the formal political arena. This is so because they know that only BLF can force the African National Congress (ANC) and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) to serve black people and end white rule in SA. BLF will not make the task of banning us from the poltical arena easy. This is war! Let the historical record reflect that BLF was the first movement to be banned since the ruse of majority rule. Let the record furthemore reflect that the banning order was imposed on BLF on the instigation of a right-wing, whites only, political organization of land thieves – the FF+. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0']));Black people now know that in SA blackness is outlawed. BLF is a revolutionary movement which will continue to fight until blacks are truly free. BLF also notes that the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has revived the false charges against the BLF 26. This is part of the general harassment of our movement through the entire justice system of this country. The Special Policy Conference shall provide a way forward for our movement. The struggle continues by any means necessary! eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_6',114,'0','0']));Land or death!
