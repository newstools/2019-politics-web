We challenge MEC Maile to show us where ARP money was spent 24 June 2019 The Gauteng MEC for Human Settlements, Lebogang Maile’s press conference yesterday in Alex was nothing more than ANC cronies covering up for each other. The MEC’s claim that the money was actually spent on the Alexandra Renewal Project (ARP) is one that makes fools of Alex residents. I have visited and engaged with Alex residents on a number of occasions, and I must state that I also share the disbelief of Alex residents that even a cent of the money allocated to the ARP ever reached this community. Where was this money spent? Certainly not in alleviating the housing crisis in Alex which remains unchanged. MEC Maile claims that the R1.3 Billion was spent on the Alex Renewal Project, but I would like to challenge the MEC to show us exactly where this R1.3 Billion was spent. Perhaps the MEC can also invite all those who were involved in the ARP, including former Premier Nomvula Mokonyane and former Mayor Parks Tau, to address us on how the money was spent. If the MEC truly believes what he told Alex residents yesterday, then I challenge him to conduct an oversight where he hosts public representatives, the SAHCR and Alex residents on a walkabout of the areas where he alleges the money was spent. I will give the MEC 48 hours to rise to this challenge and add credibility to his words by conducting the oversight. Surely if there was no corruption within the ARP, and the money was spent as it was budgeted, then this request should not be an issue, unless the MEC is protecting his brother and his fellow ANC comrades.
