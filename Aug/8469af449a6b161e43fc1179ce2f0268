Public Protector (PP) an embarrassment for South Africa and must resign 8 August 2019 Today's ruling against the Public Protector (PP), Busisiwe Mkhwebane, in favour of President Cyril Ramaphosa shows once again that she is utterly incompetent to do her job and has become an embarrassment for South Africa. The PP is supposed to protect the public against the misuse of their tax money, but seeing as the PP has lost one court case after another with costs, she herself has now become one of the biggest squanderers of tax money. The judge's statement that Mkhwebane's actions are "not understandable" confirms her utter incompetence and makes it very clear that she does not understand the basic legal principles and procedures. If Mkhwebane wants to save face and honour the office of the PP, she must do the right thing and resign. Issued by Pieter Groenewald, FF Plus leader, 8 August 2019
