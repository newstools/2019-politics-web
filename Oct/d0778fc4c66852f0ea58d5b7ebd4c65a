Thousands of residents concerned about rural safety in Gauteng 28 October 2019 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng has received over 11 500 signatures on its petition to stop the war on rural communities across the province. See the petition here: https://petitions.da.org.za/p/ruralcommunities. Since the start of the year, there have been hundreds of violent crimes in rural areas across the country. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0']));These attacks are carefully planned and correlate with the belief that guns, vehicles and cash are obtainable within relative obscurity given the isolation of settlements in rural areas The South African Police Service (SAPS) Rural Safety Strategy has been a dismal failure. In addition, police stations in the most hard-hit rural areas are understaffed, under-resourced and unable to curb crime. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2',114,'0','0']));The DA is calling on the Gauteng Provincial Government (GPG) to introduce a transversal approach to rural safety that includes the department of agriculture, social development and community safety. For example, GDARD must be able to fund innovation in new technology such as surveillance drones, ShotSpotter and geo-fencing and can expand their extension services to include an approach to safety and community collaboration. Farming plays an important role in creating job opportunities, food security and contributes to the GDP. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_3',115,'0','0']));Where we govern in the Western Cape, an inter-ministerial team has been established to address rural safety. The Western Cape government is also engaging with district municipalities regarding their safety plans with a view to funding projects that focus on innovation, partnerships and technology yet in Gauteng not much has been done in terms of rural safety. I will continue to put pressure on the Premier to implement best practice and call on all concerned South Africans to sign the petition.
