EFF CALLS ON RAMAPHOSA TO TAKE LEAVE OF ABSENCE Sunday, 21 July, 2019 The EFF calls on President Ramaphosa to take leave of absence while the Public Protector's report is subjected to a court review. He is conflicted and must be on leave until his name is cleared. No sitting president should be in direct conflict with a Chapter nine constitutional office for things he is guilty of. His Press Conference, which sought to recover lost integrity ground, was 30 minutes of blowing hot air without anything concrete. A man elected on the ticket of transparency should have revealed who funded his campaign to become President of ANC and accept the mistakes of having not declared all this money as it is required by law. This is especially because he does not deny that money was raised in his name and for him. Even he donated over 30 million to the activities of campaign for ANC president, and addresses fundraising events to that effect. The essential point therefore is, he did not declare this money to either parliament or his principal then. This is in violation of the law and the constitution of the Republic. We call on the NPA, parliament and Hawks to implement the remedial action of the Public Protector on Ramaphosa. Placing the report under a court review does not suspend the implementation of the remedial action of the PP. The Hawks must investigate money laundering in relation to the CR17 campaign; the suspicion of a crime is grounds enough to investigate such a crime. The country has had enough of presidents who disrespect our constitution and laws. Ramaphosa has just proven, barely two months into office, that he has no interest in upholding the constitution and the law. He must take a leave absence and allow others with integrity to lead the country. Statement issued by the Economic Freedom Fighters, 21 July 2019
