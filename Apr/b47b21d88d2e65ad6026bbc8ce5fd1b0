Mashaba condemns ANC for new evidence of inciting violence 15 April 2019 New evidence has emerged about how the ANC is actively involved in stoking the fires of protests in Johannesburg. This has arisen from a standard Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD) search operation which discovered an ANC branded vehicle which was loaded with old tires, in the Berea area of the inner city of Johannesburg. This discovery included ANC paraphernalia, branded material as well as delegate accreditation cards of 2 ANC members for the ANC Gauteng List Conference in December 2018. One of these members were in the vehicle at the time of the search and has subsequently been arrested. The arrested suspect is in the custody of the South African Police Service (SAPS) and JMPD is working hard to trace the ownership of the vehicle. This discovery demonstrates further irrefutable proof of the ANCâ€™s role in generating political protests. It has been evident over the past 2 weeks that the recent unrest in Johannesburg has been the subject of the ANC hijacking the legitimate grievances of communities who they have failed for over two decades. I will be arranging a meeting with the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) and the Public Protector who have initiated a joint investigation into the recent events in Alexandra. It is critical that this kind of evidence is provided to these critical Chapter 9 Institutions as a part of their investigations. It is an indictment befitting only the ANC that they are now exploiting legitimate community grievances ahead of an election, that they have been so instrumental in producing through two decades of failure, broken promises and rampant corruption.
