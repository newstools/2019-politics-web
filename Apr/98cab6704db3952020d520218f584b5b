EFF condemns the violent disruption of SABC debate by its members 5 April 2019 The EFF condemns the violent disruption of the SABC debate in Houtbay this morning by its members. We call on all fighters to exercise restraint at all times, particularly during elections. It has become common practice that many parties and prominent individuals, as well as agents of Stratcom, want to provoke the EFF and its members. This is because of the obvious progress we are making as a party and the inevitable victory on May the 8th. Whatever happens, we must never fall into this trap, as it seeks precisely to derail us from our well deserved victory. This is our election, it is our era and no amount of provocation must make us fall into the trap, particularly with insignificant political entities. We must rise above because victory is ours and it is certain. Issued by Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, National Spokesperson, 5 April 2019
