It has come to the attention of NSFAS that there are people who are misrepresenting themselves, posing as NSFAS officials soliciting applicants to pay a sum of money in order to have their application processed or have access to application forms. NSFAS would like to caution all students applying for the 2020 funding to be careful in managing their accounts. We want to stress that NSFAS applications are free. The best way to apply for NSFAS funding is through your smartphone. If you are not able to apply or do not have a smartphone, you are safe to approach the National Youth Development Agency office, or the Vodacom Teacher Training and Development Centre for assistance. We have our people stationed there to help with the applications. We are also going out into rural areas, in partnerships with various provincial departments of education. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0'])); NSFAS has set up a dedicated independent fraud hotline called Vuvuzela.  Through the hotline, whistle blowers can report abuse, fraud, wastage and other cases of misconduct to NSFAS with comfort and confidence. We appeal to students, applicants, employees and community members to report any suspicious activity promptly on fraud hotline.
