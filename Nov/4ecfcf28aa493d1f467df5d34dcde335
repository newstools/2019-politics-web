Solidarity vs Eskom: Judgment is reserved 13 November 2019 The Johannesburg Labour Court today reserved judgment in the case of the dismissal of Johan Dempers, an Eskom project manager at the Matimba and Medupi power station, who was summarily and without warning dismissed from Eskom Rotek’s service on 18 October 2019. “Mr Dempers and his fellow employees at public institutions are under siege. Incompetency is entrenched by making employees the scapegoat on a daily basis. We are waiting for the verdict and we won’t hesitate to proclaim Eskom’s incompetency from the rooftops,” said Anton van der Bijl, head of Solidarity’s Legal Services. Dempers was dismissed when Eskom Rotek claimed he had failed to deliver 1 500 tons of coal per hour to Medupi, as per instruction. According to Eskom Rotek, he also failed to report the matter to senior management. “After 31 years of faithful service, Mr Dempers’ reward was dismissal while performing his duty effectively. He was condemned for something that was not his responsibility,” Van der Bijl said. Issued by Anton van der Bijl, Head, Solidarity Legal Services, 13 November 2019
