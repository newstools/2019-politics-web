BLF 3 - Racist FF+ 0 29 April 2019 Black First Land First (BLF) has again defeated the racist Freedom Front Plus (FF+), to make it a 3-0 victory for the blacks only army! BLF, the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) and FF+ were in the Gauteng High Court today in relation to the 3rd attempt by FF+ to have BLF stopped from going to parliament. The court instructed the IEC to publish BLF’s registration as a political party and BLF will be on the ballot on the 8th of May 2019. The electoral ballot paper will see BLF listed as number 11. A number that represents the great footballer “Scara” Ngobese (RIP). Today we made it 3-0 against the racists, a hat trick that the black jesus would be proud of. BLF warns all racists abusing the courts to stop us – including FF+, Afriforum, the Democratic Alliance (DA) and all others – you will fail, nothing will stop us! BLF will continue defeating land thieves by taking the land and representing the interests of the landless in parliament! #VoteBLF Issued by Lindsay Maasdorp, National Spokesperson, BLF, 29 April 2019
