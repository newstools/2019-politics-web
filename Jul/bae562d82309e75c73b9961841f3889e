Ramaphosa cannot ignore PP remedial action against Gordhan 5 July 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) notes the Public Protector, Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s findings that Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan, violated the Constitution when he allowed for the operation of the so called South African Revenue Services (SARS) rogue unit during his tenure at the helm of the tax agency. Furthermore, the Public Protector found that Minister Gordhan lied to Parliament and the Zondo Commission when he stated that he could not recall meeting members of the Gupta family. The Public Protector recommended remedial action for President Cyril Ramaphosa to implement, should the President or Minister Gordhan believe the report is flawed, either procedurally or materially, he has the full right to take it on review – however if he elects not to, he is bound by it and has to implement its recommendations as far as it concerns him. The DA respects the Office of the Public Protector and the authority it exerts, irrespective of who holds office. Despite our views about the suitability of the incumbent, we need preserve the integrity of the Public Protector’s office as a chapter 9 institution. For this reason, findings that emanate from that office cannot be ignored. Our commitment to upholding the rule of law always supersedes personal and political disagreements. The Public Protector has now made a finding and the law must take its course. Issued by Natasha Mazzone, DA Shadow Minister of Public Enterprises, 7 July 2019
