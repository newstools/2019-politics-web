Durban CBD at a standstill as waste workers shut down streets with rubbish 30 April 2019 Motorists in Durban have been urged to take alternative routes and avoid the streets surrounding the City Hall, as a municipal workers' protest has left the roads blocked and filled with garbage. Bins have been overturned and litter has been strewn across the streets. A community notice, seen by News24, has been sent out stating that Durban Solid Waste (DSW), "together with most other Municipal departments, have joined the Water and Sanitation Department protest action". The notice went on to say that "they will not be collecting refuse until further notice". News24
