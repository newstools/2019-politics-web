BLF declares AfriForum the enemy of black people 8 March 2019 The racist AfriForum has no right to exist. The group of right-wingers have insulted the dignity of the black majority enough. Now the group, which the white owned media calls “civil rights” movement, is protecting murderers. White farmers murder blacks with the knowledge that AfriForum will use the money it stole from black people through land theft to defend these murderers. Matlhomola Mosweu was just a child. He was murdered in cold blood for fun by these racists. Now AfriForum has decided to hire lawyers to make sure these murderers are not held accountable. This is a declaration of war on black people. AfriForum has openly and proudly claimed that apartheid is not a crime against humanity. This group proudly and arrogantly displays the apartheid flag. This group has undertaken a global economic terrorism campaign against South Africa under the pretext of raising awareness about the so called farm murderers. The truth is that white farmers continue to murder blacks with impunity in South Africa. Enough is enough. From now on, Black First Land First (BLF) will treat AfriForum as a criminal racist organization which has declared war on blacks. AfriForum is defending vicious racist criminals found guilty by a court of law for various serious crimes including murder, kidnapping, intimidation, theft, and pointing a firearm.
