The real matric pass rate is 37.6% The DA congratulates all matric candidates who receive their results today. Unfortunately, we must also confront a shocking truth: the real matric pass rate is 37.6% if you include the number of 2016 Grade 10s who actually passed matric in 2018. These Grade 10s should be celebrating with other matriculants, but more than half didn’t write matric in the expected timeframe. This means only 37.6% of these Grade 10s passed matric. The others have either become stuck in a struggling education system repeating grades, or worse, dropped out of the system completely. The ‘real’ matric pass rate for each province reveals a devastating reality: only the Western Cape managed to keep over 65% of its 2016 Grade 10s in school and through to writing matric on time.  Class of 2018     Province Gr 10 (2016) Wrote NSC (2018) % Grade 10 (2016) who wrote NSC Passed NSC Passed NSC (%) ‘Real’ pass rate (%) Eastern Cape 148 346 65 733 44.3 46 393 70.6 31.3 Free State 61 244 24 914 40.7 21 806 87.5 35.6 Gauteng 172 507 94 870 55.0 83 406 87.9 48.3 KwaZulu-Natal 243 935 116 152 47.6 88 485 76.2 36.3 Limpopo 184 028 76 730 41.7 53 254 69.4 28.9 Mpumalanga 90 201 44 612 49.5 35 225 79.0 39.1 North West 66 550 29 061 43.7 23 578 81.1 35.4 Northern Cape 23 082 9 909 42.9 7 264 73.3 31.5 Western Cape 77 182 50 754 65.8 41 350 81.5 53.6 National 1 067 075 512 735 48.1 400 761 78.2 37.6 The celebrations by the Gauteng and Free State MECs is a slap in the face to the learners they failed to serve along the way. In Gauteng, 45% of its Grade 10s in 2016 didn’t write matric. The Free State, with the highest drop out in the country, has a well-known reputation for ‘culling’, or intentionally keeping back learners to inflate pass marks, as confirmed by a Deputy Director-General of the Department of Basic Education (DBE) in 2017. The DA has repeatedly called for a national investigation into ‘culling’, but Minister Angie Motshekga is not concerned. A new worry is the Multiple Exam Opportunity (MEO), which some provinces have relied on more heavily than others. It is not clear how many of these learners will actually return to complete their exams in June 2019, and many could be lost from the system in the interests of inflating provincial pass rates. The DA’s priority is clear: to ensure that learners get the best quality matric in the expected time frame, so that they can start their journey into further education and employment on time and in good stead. It is only through this commitment to quality education that learners will be able to break the cycle of poverty that so many young South Africans have been left trapped in by a failing ANC government.
