Katlehong Community Denies Setting a School Alight 8 July 2019 Following the torching of Katlehong Primary School, the Gauteng Department of Education and Youth Development accept the community’s position that they didn’t mobilise for the burning of the school, and the principals report which believed that, it might not be the community that burnt the school. Accordingly, it is suspected that this act of arson might be the work of a lone member of the community.  It is important to note that, we have an undertaking from the community to assist to track the culprit. It has been established that, only two Grade R classes were burnt, and as such the affected learners will temporarily be accommodated at two identified classes at the same school. Teaching and learning will resume as planned tomorrow, 09 July 2019. “We fully support the community’s standpoint and henceforth, we will work with them and the police to apprehend this rogue element. However, reality is that we do not have funds to repair the school, the department is at an advanced stage to check what can be salvaged from this mess,’’ said MEC Lesufi.
