Bank of Lisbon to be demolished 7 March 2019 The Gauteng Provincial Government (GPG) has conducted a structural assessment on the Bank of Lisbon Building following the fire incident which occurred in September 2018. The assessment revealed that the building sustained extensive structural damage resulting from the fire incident. Having considered the assessment report and available options to remedy the structural damage, GPG made the determination that the Bank of Lisbon Building has to be demolished. A contractor has been appointed to manage the demolition project. The building has been stabilised and the contractor is conducting investigations to determine the best and safest way of demolishing the building. All regulations and by-laws will be complied with, in carrying out the demolition project. All neighbours and affected parties have been notified of the intention to demolish the building and will be kept informed throughout the project. The Gauteng Provincial Government will make further public announcements about the project in due course. Issued by Thabo Masebe on behalf of Gauteng Provincial Governments
