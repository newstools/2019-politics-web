Law must take its course in arrest of DA Councillor 19 September 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) notes with concern the arrest of one of its PR Councillors in the Rand West City Local Municipality (RWCLM) in Randfontein on charges of alleged business robbery and possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. The DA will remove any public representative from office if they are found guilty of wrongdoing, regardless of their position. The Councillor will be placed on immediate suspension, pending the outcome of the case. If indeed he committed an offence, he must face the full might of the law as no one is above the law. The DA will not shy away from holding its own public representatives accountable. Issued by John Moodey, DA Gauteng Provincial Leader, 19 September 2019
