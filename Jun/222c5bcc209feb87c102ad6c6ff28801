Police should not die with their guns 25 June 2019 The Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union (POPCRU) is infuriated by yet another unfortunate death of a police officer in Steenberg, Western Cape last night when they were pursuing five suspects in the area. The killing of police is once again on an increase, and this perturbing trend cannot be left unattended. We urge police officers to work in larger groups and be wary of the environments they operate under, and when their lives are under threat, they should act decisively. Police can no longer die with their firearms. We appeal to our communities to work together with law enforcement agencies in finding the culprits and in ensuring general information is shared when dealing with criminal elements within our communities, and to build lasting relations that will help us jointly make our areas safer. We urge the SAPS management to speedily attend to ensuring the increased of police officers, improved infrastructural integrity and tools of work in ensuring visibility and better service delivery.
