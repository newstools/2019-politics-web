Communications Committee puts on hold shortlisting for SABC board 26 February 2019 The Portfolio Committee on Communications has resolved to put on hold the shortlisting of 24 candidates who were going to be interviewed to fill the eight vacancies at the board of the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC). Given the history of challenges at the SABC board, the committee decided to conduct exit interviews with those who resigned from the current board. The remaining four non-executive members in the current board will be invited to provide progress reports on investigations into board member Mr Dinkwanyane Mohuba’s qualifications, the turnaround strategy, labour relations issues and progress with implementing the recommendations of the Ad Hoc Committee. The exit interviews will be conducted on 5 March 2019. “It is important for the public to understand the amount of effort the department has taken to resolve the financial situation at the SABC, whereby the Minister has reported that a team has been put together to assist the SABC in producing financial projections, which will stabilise the SABC,” said Prof Hlengiwe Mkhize, Chairperson of the committee. Prof Mkhize said the committee is determined to be rigorous in its processes, including vetting qualifications and security clearance for applicants, to avoid the recurrence of individuals misleading Parliament.
