EFF statement of solidarity on Sudan civil conflict 13 June 2019 The EFF expresses solidarity on the deaths of unarmed and peaceful protestors who died following anti-military rule protests in Sudan, particularly in Khartoum. The reports have placed the blame on paramilitary groups and the military itself, for use of excessive force on unarmed and peaceful protests. We condemn any use of force against a protesting people. The right to protest is a peaceful right that must be respected by any military, even in the absence of actual executives. The people of Sudan have successfully deposed, through mass work and protests, Al Bashir, and no amount of military force could stop them. Their resilience and formidability has already been tried and tested. The demand for civilian and democratic rule is urgent, and must be conceded to by the military council in-charge since the fall of Bashir. We call on all influential govemments in the world, from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, to Ethiopia and the African Union, to push the military council to make way for non-negotiable civilian rule. We express condolences on all who have lost their lives, particularly protestors. We condemn the use of terror, particularly rape, as a means to shut down protests and demands for civilian rule.
