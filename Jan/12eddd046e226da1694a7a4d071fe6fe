DA slams Zuma's eThekwini record deal The Democratic Alliance (DA) in eThekwini has slammed media reports that the City's Parks, Recreation and Culture Unit will be funding the recording of former President Jacob Zuma's favorite struggle songs in 2019. This record deal is blatant patronage where the people's money will be used to finance the former President's lifestyle. Recent reports state that Thembinkosi Ngcobo and Councillor Thembo Ntuli met with Zuma and according to Ngcobo the record deal will boost economic development by promoting cultural activities. This proposal has not served before any committee of Council, nor has it been adopted by the Council. The DA has been calling for greater accountability and functionality of the city's Parks Unit. The Unit has seemingly gone rogue, abandoning many of its core functions in favour of flashy events and concerts. It is now clear for all to see that the eThekwini Municipality has become completely captured by the failing ANC. Whilst the history of our country holds immense value to us all, it is impossible that any rational person would believe that a corrupt and disgraced former president singing ANC struggle songs holds any benefit to the people of eThekwini. The DA will be writing to the City Manager, asking him to reign in the Parks Unit and put a stop to this unethical project. The DA will fight this matter tooth and nail in the interests of all who prioritize service delivery over politics. Statement issued by Nicole Graham Cllr, DA eThekwini Councillor, 2 January 2018
