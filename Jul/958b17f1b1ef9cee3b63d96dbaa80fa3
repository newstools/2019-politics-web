Speaker submits report on EFF disruption to sub-committee of Parliament 16 July 2019 The Speaker of the National Assembly, Ms Thandi Modise, has referred the report on the disruption and the physical removal of the Economic Freedom Fighters MPs during the Budget Vote of the Department of Public Enterprise to the Subcommittee on the Physical Removal of Members from the Chamber. The referral by the Speaker follows her receipt of a briefing on what transpired during the sitting from House Chairperson Matlala Boroto, who presided over the debate on 11 July 2019. The Subcommittee on the Physical Removal of Members from the Chamber, which reports to the Rules Committee, is chaired by Deputy Speaker Mr Lechesa Tsenoli. It is responsible for considering the circumstances of the physical removals of MPs from the Chamber as reported to it by the Speaker in terms of House Rule 73 (12). In terms of this Rule 73 (12), whenever an MP is physically removed from the Chamber, the circumstances of such removal must be referred for this subcommittee, which must look into the conduct of the Member concerned, the ruling by the presiding officer and the manner in which the Member was removed. The mandate of this committee, however, is not to conduct a disciplinary proceeding against the MP or to review the ruling of the presiding officer. After considering the referral by the Speaker, the subcommittee must report its findings and recommendations to the Rules Committee within 10 working days. The Rules Committee will, based on the report of the subcommittee, determine the appropriate course of action. Issued by Moloto Mothapo on behalf of Parliament, 16 July 2019
