Limusa rejects the appointment of Daniel du Toit as the Group CEO at Denel 07 January 2019 We find it disgusting and very irresponsible for the State Owned Entity like Denel to ignore the shocking findings of the Hoefyster Employment Equity Compliance Assessment report and continue to employ another white male of Daniel du Toit as the Group Chief Executive. One of the recommendations in the HEECA report which we fully support is that Denel must immediately stop the appointment and employment of white males in important positions.That recommendation was based on the findingthat Denel seem to be overlooking other races when it comes to employment in strategic positions and we as Limusa raised this complaint with Denel in 2017 as we saw Black professionals in particular being overlookedin favour of White and Indian males. Denel arrogantly ridiculed our complaint but HEECA report has proven us correct. We have learned that Black Management Forum is in support of what Limusa have been fighting for since 2017 and that it is legally challenging Denel on the appointment of Daniel du Toit. We have always been consistent in that we are against this unlawful behavior of deviding workers racially by Denel and therefore asLimusa we are going to support any action that seek to challenge the Employment Equity injustices that happens in Denel.We reject the appointment of Daniel du Toitas Denel Group CEO when there are many Black professionals qualified for this position. We will not stop to fight and expose these unlawful acts until Denel do the right thing and stop employing people based on their colour. We call on the minister in the Department of Public Enterprises Pravin Gordan to provide necessary leadership in ensuring that the recommendations of the HEECA report are implemented as Denel promised four months back. We further call on the parliament to look at this matter closely and enforce Denel to comply with the Equity Act. Issued by Limusa Secretariat, 7 January 2019
