DA welcomes judgement against ANC on MONC secret ballot 29 January 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng notes the North Gauteng High Court’s judgement which sets aside the failing African National Congress’ (ANC) application to declare as invalid the Speaker of Tshwane’s ruling to conduct the vote of no confidence in the Executive Mayor of Tshwane, Mr. Solly Msimanga, through an open ballot. The judgement found the ANCs argument to be ‘fatally defective and not convincing’ and the ANC has been ordered to pay the legal costs of the respondents. These findings relate to the Motion of No Confidence which was tabled by the failing ANC on 22 August  2018. This motion was subsequently defeated in an open ballot on 27 September 2018. However, the failing ANC argued that the meeting held on 27 September was invalid and illegal, and that the refusal by the Speaker to conduct a motion of no confidence against the Executive Mayor was irrational. The court has vindicated our assertion that the ANC’s application was a desperate, last-ditch attempt to validate its frivolous motion of no confidence in Mayor Msimanga. Residents of Tshwane and voters in Gauteng should be aware that this judgment also reveals that the failing ANC has never had any real basis to smear the good name of Solly Msimanga, as they do. Indeed, they have been horribly exposed as being highly desperate to regain control in order to resume the corruption that abounded prior to them losing the election in 2016. However, we will not be deterred in our work and will continue serving the people of Tshwane. While the ANC focuses on political games in the City, our first priority will always be service delivery and putting the people first.
