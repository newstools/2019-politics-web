ANC TO OPEN CASE AGAINST STEVE HOFMEYR IN CAPE TOWN The African National Congress (ANC) will tomorrow, Thursday, 20 June 2019 lay criminal charges against Steve Hofmeyr for his racist and inhumane rants on Social Media which smacks of barbarism, white supremacy and toxic masculinity Hofmeyr issued death threats against South Africa’s Ambassador to Denmark, Zindzi Mandela-Hlongwane and DA MP Phumzile Van Damme.  His string of social media posts denigrating Mandela-Hlongwane and Van Damme hark back to the crude apartheid past and something that no South African should tolerate. This in our eyes demonstrates white arrogance and is a textbook example of white privilege which must be nipped in the bud. The ANC urges South Africans to isolate people that continue to promote racism in our country. The ANC remains resolute in its campaign to building a non-racial, democratic and prosperous society. We will therefore continue to campaign fearlessly and tirelessly for the total isolation of apartheid remnants masquerading as advocates of racism at every public opportunity they get. Our communities must expose such individuals for who they are and what they stand for. The ANC will lay a charge of crimen injuria against Steve Hofmeyr on behalf of its member and leader Comrade Zinzi Mandela-Hlongwane. The ANC holds no brief to sympathise with racists, and will not hesitate to report their conduct to authorities regardless of their public standing. Racists have no place in our democratic country.  The ANC will continue with its efforts to build a non-racial, non-sexist, democratic and united South Africa. The ANC will lay charges in the police station, details as follows: Date: Thursday, 20 June 2019 Time: 11H00 Avenue: Cape Town Police Station, Cnr. Barrack and Buitenkant Street Statement issued by the African National Congress, 19 June 2019
