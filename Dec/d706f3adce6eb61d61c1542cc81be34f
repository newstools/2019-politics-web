Guptas can collect new passports after appearing before Zondo Commission The Guptas, who have been implicated in state capture facilitated by a corrupt ANC government have applied to have their passports renewed while living in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The arrogance of this family has no bounds. It is common knowledge that the Guptas fled South Africa as evidence of their involvement in the ANC’s state capture continued to mount. Nonetheless, collecting their new passports in Pretoria is the perfect opportunity for members of the Gupta family to return to South Africa and appear before the Zondo Commission to answer to the allegations levelled against them for their involvement in the ANC’s state capture project. Home Affair Minister Aaron Motsaledi’s decision to place the new passports in a safe in Pretoria does not inspire confidence, he must tell us on what legal basis is he withholding the passports. The law should be followed in this matter. We are all well aware that his predecessor, Minister Malusi Gigaba, irregularly, if not illegally, fast-tracked the naturalisation of members of the Gupta family. However, this is but one allegation that can be ironed out before the Zondo Commission. As soon as Parliament reconvenes in the new year, the DA will submit written questions to Minister Motsoaledi to provide the nation with a clear explanation of his decision to withhold the passports.
