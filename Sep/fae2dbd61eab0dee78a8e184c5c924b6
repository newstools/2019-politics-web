FF Plus supports investigation into donations made to Members of Parliament 30 September 2019 The FF Plus supports the call of economists, like Professor Jannie Rossouw and others, who have requested that all Members of Parliament (MPs) must be investigated to determine whether they have received any donations from controversial companies, like Steinhoff, Bosasa or any other companies that have ties with the Guptas. Such an investigation must be expanded to also determine whether the MPs have any business ties with these companies. Then the information must be disclosed publicly so that the people can know which politicians and which political parties benefited from donations from or business ties with the said companies. I myself have not received any donations or benefited in any other way from any of these companies and will launch an investigation to determine whether any of the FF Plus's MPs have ties with the companies or have received any donations or benefits. The public is entitled to know which MPs have ties or have had ties in the past with enterprises that do not act in the best interests of taxpayers. This investigation must be done to ensure that these enterprises are not handled with kid gloves in case it should happen that they are called to appear before Parliament to account for their activities.
