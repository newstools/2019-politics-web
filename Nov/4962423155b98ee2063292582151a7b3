MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT APPEARS IN COURT ON A CHARGE OF CORRUPTION 21 NOVEMBER 2019 South African Member of Parliament, Bongani Bongo, appeared at Cape Town Magistrates Court this morning on a charge of corruption after he offered Advocate Ntuthuzelo Vanara an unlawful gratification. Bongo was released on bail of R5 000 with conditions not to interfere with any state witnesses and to inform the investigating officer two weeks prior his planned travel outside of the country either through a telephone call, email or WhatsApp. The investigating officer must respond within 24 hours to acknowledge receipt of the request. The investigation in the matter is finalised and the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) in the Western Cape, Advocate Rodney de Kock, has decided to try it in the Western Cape High Court. The State is in a position to postpone for a high court date but the defence indicated that they wish to make representations to the DPP for a review of the decision to prosecute.

The terms of reference for the proposed enquiry required the assessment of the Board of Eskom's ability to discharge its fiduciary duties, including: Looking into the financial status and sustainability of Eskom The response by Eskom to the Public Protector Report: State Capture findings into the conduct of the former Group Chief Executive Officer, Mr Brian Molefe, The reappointment of Mr Brian Molefe, The determination of the retirement package for Mr Brian Molefe The State alleges that in October 2017 at Parliament, Bongo offered Adv Vanara an unlawful gratification in the form of a monetary benefit, requesting him to decide on the exact amount required, to stop the enquiry from proceeding. Adv Vanara refused the offer and reported the accused's conduct. The case has been postponed to 31 January 2020 Statement issued by Eric Ntabazalila, NPA Regional Communications Manager, 21 November 2019
