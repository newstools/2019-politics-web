Emfuleni Municipality owes Eskom R1.7 billion 29 October 2019 eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_4',112,'0','0']));The people of Emfuleni will again pay the price for poor governance by the ANC. This comes as Eskom threatens to cut electricity to residents due to non-payment of R1.7 billion that the Emfuleni Municipality owes to it. The Democratic Alliance (DA) has been reliably informed that secret meetings are taking place between Eskom and the Emfuleni Local Municipality regarding its plan to cut off its electricity supply. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0']));Eskom informed the municipality in a letter dated 17 October 2019 that it would start power cuts on 6 November 2019. The DA will continue holding the ANC in Emfuleni to account. It is time that the people are put first and are given the services they deserve. In the face of the R1.7 billion debt to Eskom, it came as little surprise when the Municipality moved to increase the electricity tariff by almost 21%. These electricity tariffs were set aside by the High Court last week. The Emfuleni Municipality has been under provincial intervention since June 2018 and partial administration since March 2019. The Financial Recovery Plan has not shown any results. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_1',115,'0','0']));The DA will during the Municipality’s next Council sitting on 7 November 2019 table a motion to place the Emfuleni Municipality under full administration as per Section 139 1(c) of the Constitution. Only a DA-led government can bring positive change to the people of Emfuleni and build one South Africa for all. Issued by Dady Mollo, DA Emfuleni Central Constituency Head, 29 October 2019
