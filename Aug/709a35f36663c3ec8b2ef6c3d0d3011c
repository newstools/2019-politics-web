DA retains two wards in Gauteng by-elections 8 August 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) comfortably retained Ward 15 in Ekurhuleni and Ward 8 in Rand West City Local Municipality during the by-elections yesterday. Both of these are ANC-governed municipalities, where DA Ward Councillors serve in our opposition DA caucus. We are highly encouraged that the DA retained these wards and are committed to keep working hard to fight for better service delivery and to put residents first. The DA is confident that the elected ward councillors, Amanda Davison and Nicolette Claudine Kiewietz  will continue serving their communities unrelentingly. We thank all the residents who voted for us again, so that we can keep working to bring about change to the people of Gauteng. Where we govern in Gauteng, we are providing more efficient services such as improving the water supply to informal settlements, exposing corruption, creating jobs and extending clinic hours. These wards became vacant when two Ward councillors were elected to Parliament in the recent national and provincial elections. The DA is committed to bring change to the people of Gauteng, and build one South Africa for all. Issued by John Moodey, Gauteng Provincial Leader, 8 August 2019
