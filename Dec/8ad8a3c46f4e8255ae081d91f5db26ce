AfriForum needs public support against expropriation without compensation 12 December 2019 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0']));The civil rights organisation AfriForum will launch a public support campaign today to take a stand against expropriation without compensation. This follows after the Parliamentary Ad Hoc Committee tasked with the amendment of the Constitution published a Bill aimed at amending the Constitution on this issue. The public has until 31 January 2020 to comment on the Bill. Ernst Roets, Head of Policy and Action at AfriForum, says the decision to publish the Bill during the December holiday is no coincidence. He encourages the public to help prevent the Bill from being pushed through unnoticed and AfriForum requests members of the public to give them a mandate to oppose the Bill. “AfriForum has already instructed its legal team to prepare commentary on the Bill. This response will be submitted to Parliament in January. We do however need as much support from the public as possible to strengthen our voice on this matter,” says Roets. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));The public can support AfriForum’s campaign by visiting the website https://www.onteiening.co.za/en/.
