VBS Saga: The ANC doesn’t care about burning tyres – vote them out! 14 March 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in North West wants to see every person implicated in the VBS scandal to be investigated, tried and where found guilty, sent to jail. ANC corruption and failed governance have now resulted in total chaos throughout the North West as service delivery has come to a halt, especially in municipalities where the ANC looted money through the VBS Bank Heist. The corrupt ANC continues to protect criminal cadres despite the overwhelming evidence against them. There is no new dawn under Cyril Ramaphosa’s ANC. The corrupt ANC has failed to take action against mayors, municipal managers or the chief financial officers of the municipalities implicated in the VBS heist. We respect people’s right to protest, but the DA can never condone violence. We understand the extreme frustration of the people in Kagisano Molopo and Naledi who have taken to the streets, but we call for peaceful protest and urge all people who bear the brunt of failed and corrupt ANC governance to use the power of their vote to bring real change to the North West on 8 May 2019. It is because of the failed ANC that people living within these municipalities suffer without water, sanitation, housing and unemployment. The DA has laid criminal charges against former Premier Supra Mahumapelo last year, following strong allegations that he abused his position to facilitate the investment of R314 million of the people’s money with VBS bank from the Madibeng, Moretele, Dr. Ruth Segomotsi Mompati, and Mahikeng municipalities. The DA has exercised its oversight role diligently. The DA remains the only party that can save the North West. In government, the DA will ensure that the minimum jail sentence for corruption be set at 15 years. Issued by Joe McGluwa, DA North West Premier Candidate, 14 March 2019
