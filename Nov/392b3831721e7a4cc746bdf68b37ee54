Gauteng Department of Sports wastes R2.5 million on DSTV Delicious International Food and Music Festival 7 November 2019 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0']));The Gauteng Department of Sports, Arts, Culture and Recreation (SACR) spent R2.5 million on the DSTV Delicious International Food and Music Festival while our townships lack proper sporting facilities. This was revealed by Gauteng SACR MEC Mbali Hlophe in an oral reply to my questions in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature (GPL). According to the MEC, the department partnered with the DSTV Delicious International Food and Music Festival for the first time this year in hosting this annual event. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));It is deeply disappointing that the department is prioritising spending on wining and dining while our communities are in dire need of proper sporting grounds. The DA believes that this money would have been more wisely spent on programmes that will unearth and nurture local talent in different sporting codes as well as grassroots development. While we understand the importance of public private partnerships, the department should not invest in frivolous projects. It must consider its core mandate which is to provide adequate services to the people of Gauteng instead of wasting money on such events. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));The DA will continue to monitor the expenditure of public funds by this department to ensure that the needs of residents are prioritised, and that the money is spent on fulfilling the core mandate of this department.
