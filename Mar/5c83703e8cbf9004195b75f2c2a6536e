Communication devices of Deputy Secretary General of ANC have been hacked 29 March 2019 It has come to the attention of the African National Congress (ANC) that the communication devices of the Deputy Secretary General, Cde Jessie Duarte, have been hacked. Her emails and messaging systems have been targeted and interfered with. A WhatsApp text purporting to be from the Deputy Secretary General has also been circulated. We find these actions reprehensible with the only objective to cause harm, invoke anger and cause instability. As a revolutionary movement, the ANC and its leadership have sadly grown accustomed to its opponents using all sorts of dirty tricks to soil the reputation of the ANC and its leadership. The ANC shall look at taking further preventative measures to ensure that its leadership is able to communicate in privacy and safety. The DSG shall lay criminal charges with the South African Police Services and request an investigation. In the interim we call on all who have received WhatsApp texts or emails from the DSG to rather discard them before opening them. Issued by Dakota Legoete, National Spokesperson, ANC, 29 March 2019
