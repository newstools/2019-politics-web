Media statement Johann van Loggerenberg  15 November 2019eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_4',112,'0','0'])); I have noted the media statement of the Public Protector today. The media statement concerns a 2014 report of the Inspector-General of Intelligence which was supposed to look into serious allegations against persons associated with the State Security Agency, its Special Operations Unit and other branches. The Inspector-General of Intelligence at the time clearly failed to do so. The current Inspector-General of Intelligence has recently confirmed that these are now being considered. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_5',113,'0','0']));I have read the redacted report since its release to the Public Protector and other parties. It is nothing but a concoction of lies, disinformation, fraudulent claims and a complete cover-up of evidence and facts that implicate persons associated with the State Security Agency, its Special Operations Unit and other branches, as well as other state intelligence operatives and private entities and persons associated with the “Services”. It also purports to express “findings” and “recommendations” of and to the South African Revenue Service which are mala fide and ultra vires. To the extent that I was aware of the content of the report in September 2019, I deposed to an affidavit (complete with evidentiary substantiation), dispelling the content. None of the parties involved in the litigation attempted to refute or challenge my evidence. In fact, all opposing parties accepted my evidence and even sought to rely on parts thereof during argument. I shall be challenging the report in court in due course to seek to have it reviewed and set aside. During this process I shall demonstrate these lies and cover-ups. At this stage, it should be noted that the report i) fails to reflect on any facts and evidence registered by me on 25 August, 15 September and 29 September 2014 with the Inspector-General of Intelligence, and ii) completely relies on hearsay, vague, false and defamatory allegations (that are completely unsubstantiated) by precisely persons that I, on behalf of the South African Revenue Service, implicated (such records and evidence seemingly “lost” since). eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_6',114,'0','0']));I deny every single adverse allegation contained therein. I would suggest no person take it serious for any purpose whatsoever, redacted or not. I further note: - Almost a month ago, on 18 October 2019, the Minister of State Security tendered the redacted copy of the report in terms of a Notice in terms of Rule 34(2) of the Uniform Rules of Court. More than a week ago, on 5 November 2019, the Minister of State Security delivered such redacted report to all relevant parties. There was no “settlement”. Instead, on 6 November 2019, the Public Protector persisted with the opposition of an interlocutory application brought by the Minister of State Security in this regard. Judgement in this matter is being awaited. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_7',115,'0','0']));- Rule 43 of the Uniform Rules of Court deals with “Matrimonial Matters”.
