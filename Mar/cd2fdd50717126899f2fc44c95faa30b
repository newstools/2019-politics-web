Minister Tito Mboweni exposes ANC lies over e-tolls 29 March 2019 COPE is very much surprised that the focus of the e-tolls saga has now shifted from addressing social outcry to the outburst by Finance Minister Tito  Mboweni who suggested that Sanral's decision to suspend actions against e-tolls defaulters is irresponsible... In our view, Mboweni’s position exposes the dishonesty of his party, the ANC. Lies are slowly catching up with David Makhura, the Gauteng Premier. He has to face the consequences of having lied to citizens for years, about the intention to scrap the e-toll system in Gauteng. Makhura will learn the hard way that he cannot undermine the intelligence of South African citizens. COPE encourages the citizens of Gauteng to use their power on the 8th of May, to vote the ANC out of power. This government has once again proven to be  corupt and dishonest. The ANC government has failed the citizens of Gauteng. We call upon all South Africans to give COPE a chance, we commit ourselves to govern this country better. COPE is reiterating its position that the e-toll system must be eradicated. The citizens of Gauteng should decide the future of the e-tolls.
