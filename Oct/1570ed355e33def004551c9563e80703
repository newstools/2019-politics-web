FF Plus will continue to put pressure on government to help with drought in the Northern Cape 9 October 2019 The promise made by the Deputy president, Mr David Mabuza, to offer financial support to the farmers in the drought-stricken Northern Cape is welcomed; but it must not be an empty promise and the FF Plus will continue to put pressure on the government to offer farmers the support they need.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0'])); Lessons can be learnt from the drought in Namibia, which nearly halved the country's livestock numbers. The South African government may not allow the same situation to play out here in the Northern Cape. The FF Plus will also put pressure on the government to ensure that the Northern Cape is declared a national disaster area so that funds from the disaster relief emergency fund can be made available.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0'])); The recent visit paid to the area by the FF Plus (Dr Pieter Groenewald) and the Deputy president was one of the steps in the right direction to bring this about. The FF Plus welcomes the recognition that Mr Mabuza gave the FF Plus following the party's request in Parliament earlier this year that urgent attention must be paid to the drought conditions in the Northern Cape that have been prevalent for years and that have taken on disastrous proportions. With his visit to the area last Friday, the Deputy president experienced the destruction of the drought first-hand and he said that the area should be declared a disaster area.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0'])); This will also give recognition to the significant role that farmers play in filling the country's food basket. These words must now be followed by actions and the FF Plus will make sure that happens. Issued by Pieter Groenewald, FF Plus leader, 9 October 2019
