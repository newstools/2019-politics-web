Loss of weapons at SA National Defence Force (SANDF) disturbing 4 April 2019 The theft and loss of weapons and ammunition at the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) remains worrying and it seems as if the defence force is unable to be proactive in addressing crime and the lack of discipline in its own ranks. From 1 April 2016 up to date, 58 weapons, including 30 dangerous weapons like assault rifles, have either been lost or stolen. Nearly 8000 rounds of ammunition have been stolen, mainly for assault rifles, as well as 36 hand grenades. This information was gleaned from the answer provided by the Minister of Defence and Military Veterans (Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula) in response to written parliamentary questions on the matter by the FF Plus. The defence force must pay serious attention to discipline and general crime within its ranks seeing as the public is increasingly losing faith in the SANDF. It is shocking to think how much damage and bloodshed those stolen weapons could cause and how many of these weapons could land in the hands of criminals involved in organised crime, like transit heists. The SANDF cannot become a source of weapons and ammunition for criminals. The poor discipline and poor management of the defence force is such that it contributes to the crime in South Africa and that seriously taints the reputation of the SANDF. This must be rectified urgently. A defence force simply cannot function without proper management and discipline.
