184 Gauteng Health staff have businesses that deal with Government 6 October 2019 184 staff who work for the Gauteng Health Department (GHD) have their own private businesses that deal with government departments, including the GHD.eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_3',112,'0','0'])); This is revealed by Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku in a written reply to my questions in the Gauteng Legislature. These employees were identified by the Gauteng Audit Service and the Auditor General’s 2018/19 Report. They are involved in a wide range of businesses, including medical supplies, food, events management, health publishing, emergency care, security and funeral services.eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0'])); It is not presently known how many GHD staff get business from the Department itself. According to Masuku, “a detailed report has been requested from the Head of Department. A deadline of Monday the 14th October 2019 has been given. Once the information has been provided it will be forwarded to the legislature.” I am concerned that employees doing business with their own department has taken so long to uncover. This is highly irregular in a department that has suffered many corruption scandals. I look forward to the detailed report that has been promised, which should be followed by strict discipline of staff who are caught out in this matter.eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2',114,'0','0'])); Issued by Jack Bloom, DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC, 6 October 2019
