African National Congress in the Western Cape Returns donation from Dr Iqbal Survé 7 May 2019 The African National Congress (ANC) in the Western Cape has decided to return the donation made by the philanthropist and media tycoon, Dr Iqbal Survè. Accordingly, the Provincial Treasurer has been instructed to execute this decision immediately. During the course of our election campaign, we have been approached by many individuals and organisations who have expressed their wish to support the rejuvenation and renewal of the ANC as well as the renewed wave of confidence in our economy, country and movement. Following a thorough assessment, we would then decide if we would accept a particular donation and how it would be used. Due to the fact that this happened a mere three days before the election, we had no time to do such an assessment or to consider how such a donation would be perceived given the revelations made at the Commission of Inquiry into allegations of impropriety regarding the Public Investment Corporation. We remain confident that, despite the fact that we need all help at this stage, returning the donation is the right to do. Issued by Khaya Magaxa, Acting Chair of the ANC Western Cape, 7 May 2019
