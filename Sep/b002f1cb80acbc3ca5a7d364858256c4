The Economic Freedom Fighter leader Julius Malema posted a tribute to Robert Mugabe on Twitter on Saturday to his 2,6 million followers which clearly was meant to be read as a call for the dispossession and expulsion of South Africa’s white minority. The tribute involved a number of quotes by the late Zimbabwean tyrant and race fanatic set against images of Mugabe with liberation music playing in the background. The full script follows below. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0', 0]));"What we hate is not the colour of their skins but the evil that emanates from them.

I am termed dictator because I have rejected this supremacist view and frustrated the neocolonialists.

The white man is not indigenous to Africa. Africa is for Africans. Zimbabwe is for Zimbabweans.  There will never be a regime change here. There will always be the people of Zimbabwe in control, neither Bush no Blair can bring about regime change here. Never. We’ll never accept it. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-large-mobile-banner-1','ezslot_6',124,'0', 0])); There are some blacks who have acquired these media conglomerates.

We now have aeroplanes which can take them back quicker than the ships used by their ancestors."  The tribute then concludes: "South Africa needs a second liberation."  *** Rest in power #GUSHUNGO pic.twitter.com/TQk5bQaTKe On the face of it the tribute is, in purpose and intent, in contravention of applicable European law against the propagation of racial hatred or Volksverhetzung, which is binding on Twitter, as well as company’s own stated terms of service on "hurtful speech". This states inter alia: “Hateful conduct: You may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease. We also do not allow accounts whose primary purpose is inciting harm towards others on the basis of these categories.” This policy also states: “If you see something on Twitter that you believe violates our hateful conduct policy, please report it to us.” The company soon made clear however that it does not believe such rules are applicable in Africa: Stratcom #GUSHUNGO pic.twitter.com/2fNiNPlIDE
