Elderly woman abused at Mamelodi Hospital – Jack Bloom 30 May 2019 I am horrified by the abuse of a 76-year-old woman, Martha Marais, at the Mamelodi Hospital. According to a Facebook post by Virginia Keppler: “Nursing staff at the Mamelodi Hospital tied her hands behind her back and to these chairs, forcing her to lay on the cold floor since Tuesday night. Nursing staff ignored her, yet the staff at Eersterust clinic referred her because she needs urgent medical attention.” There are photos and videos which show Mrs Marais tied up and lying on the floor under the chairs while her distressed daughter berates the security guards for their shocking treatment of her. I have sent this to Professor Mac Lukhele, Head of the Gauteng Health Department, for his immediate attention. Mamelodi Hospital is notorious for poor treatment of patients. I hope that the new Health MEC Bandile Masuku intervenes urgently fix the deep-seated problems at this hospital. Mrs Marais has been shockingly abused rather than treated with the extra respect one would expect with an elderly person. A full investigation is needed so that this never happens again to any other patient. Issued by Jack Bloom, DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC, 30 May 2019
