Residents are reminded that water restrictions remain in place even though dam levels are slowly recovering. Read more below: Cape Town’s collective water consumption increased by 28 million litres per day for the past week, to 583 million litres per day (up from 555 m/l per day). Further rains this past week have seen dam levels recover to 61,8% of storage capacity; however, we are not yet in a position where we can safely relax our water savings efforts. Residents are encouraged to continue using water sparingly and to remain water wise. The City would like to thank all water warriors who constantly strive to reduce their consumption and save this precious resource.  Although consumption has increased, we are within the daily allocation of 650 million litres per day. Water restrictions remain in place to aid dam recovery. Issued by City of Cape Town, 15 July 2019
