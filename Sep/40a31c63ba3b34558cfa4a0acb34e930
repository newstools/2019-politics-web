First batch of new EMS vehicles delivered to City of Joburg 23 September 2019 Today, I am pleased to announce that the City of Johannesburg has received the first batch of new Emergency Management Services (EMS) vehicles, as part of the critical fleet renewal programme.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0'])); The renewal of the City’s EMS fleet, which includes fire and rescue vehicles, is a long-awaited and much needed service delivery initiative which will directly impact in the lives of our residents. In the coming months, we expect to add over 90 EMS vehicles to our existing fleet. This is unprecedented in the City of Johannesburg. I was joined today by the MMC for Public Safety, Cllr Michael Sun, and the acting MMC for Group Corporate and Shared Services (GCSS), Cllr Leah Knott, as the City took delivery of these 10 rapid intervention vehicles, with five more due by the end of this week.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0'])); These vehicles are a critical resource within EMS since firefighters are able to use them for first response. Rapid intervention vehicles often arrive first on scene where firefighters are able to assess the situation and call for the appropriate firefighting resources. These vehicles also carry rescue equipment that EMS utilise in responding to motor vehicle accidents. In June, EMS received 42 brand new ambulances which replaced the broken down and aging fleet. This brought the EMS fleet to hundred and one (101) ambulances servicing Joburg residents. All 30 stations each received at least one new ambulance. Furthermore, the City expects to take delivery of batches of emergency vehicles, including pumper fire engines, at the end of each month.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0'])); I would like to thank the members of our coalition government, the IFP, ACDP, COPE, UDM and Freedom Front Plus for their continued support in bringing change to the residents of our City. I also wish to thank members of the EFF caucus, who vote with us on an issue by issue basis, for their efforts in helping to improve the lives of our residents.
