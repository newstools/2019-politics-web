Sisi Ntomela’s selections show that ANC puts its own interests before the Free State’s 28 May 2019 The Free State Premier, Ms Sisi Ntombela's, selection of certain MECs is shocking to say the least. Ntombela is not taking the crisis in which the Free State finds itself seriously and it was confirmed by the thoughtless appointments that she made today. The appointment of the former mayor of the embattled Moqhaka Municipality (Kroonstad, Viljoenskroon, Steynsrus), Ms Tshidi Koloi, as MEC for Public Works is absolutely shocking. Under Koloi's leadership, the Moqhaka Municipality was basically ruined. It is also disappointing that Ntombela decided not to reduce the number of portfolios in her provincial cabinet. Clearly the required changes were not made due to infighting and faction formation within the Free State ANC. Certain people were only appointed to keep certain factions happy. Once again, the ANC is putting the interests of the party before the interests of the people of the Free State. A question mark also hangs over the experience of some of the MECs seeing as five new members, who have no experience in the executive authority or even in the Legislature, were appointed. The hope for a new government with better priorities and the political will to improve the Free State faded away today because Ace Magashule's influence over the selection of the MECs is still glaringly obvious. The FF Plus will hold each and every MEC accountable for the functioning of his or her department. Issued by Devar Smit, FF Plus MPL: Free State Legislature, 28 May 2019
