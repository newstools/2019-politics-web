DA calls for SIU findings into Eskom corruption to be handed over to Zondo Commission The Democratic Alliance (DA) is calling on the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) to present a report of its preliminary findings on industrial scale looting at Eskom power plants by contractors, before the Zondo Commission for inclusion as part of evidence into state capture. New evidence has since emerged from media reports that 11 contractors are currently under SIU for allegedly stealing R139 billion during the construction of Eskom power plants at Kusile, Medupi and Ingula. The Zondo Commission should call on all the implicated contractors to come and give evidence before the commission on the role that each played in this staggering theft of public resources. It is insincere for the failing ANC government to claim ignorance while taxpayers money was being stolen by unscrupulous business people whom they had contracted to build the power plants. The ANC knew about Eskom corruption and they must take responsibility for failing to act on it. Now, more than ever, it has become clear that the ANC has broken Eskom, left it bankrupt and is now asking South Africans to pick up the tab through power tariff increases. Eskom is currently waiting to hear the outcome of its application for a 15% power tariff hike over 15 years. Government’s plans to unbundle Eskom will not turn around the ailing parastatal as long as the culture of corruption and poor corporate governance is not addressed as a matter of urgency. The DA’s proven track record in fighting corruption where we govern is the perfect antidote that Eskom needs to deal with corrupt networks that have taken root at the parastatal. South African’s have an opportunity on the 8th of May to vote for a DA government that will protect their tax money from abuse by politically connected corrupt syndicates.
