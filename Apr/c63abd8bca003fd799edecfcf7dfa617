Xenophobia: ANC reaping the bitter fruit of poor border control The latest wave of xenophobic attacks in South Africa are the result of the ANC's poor and inadequate control of the country's borders, particularly the northern border of South Africa. The ANC is now reaping the bitter fruit of its poor border control and must, therefore, accept full responsibility for the attacks. It is unfair that tax payers must pay for illegal immigrants and that tax money is not used for the benefit of the country's own citizens. A country's first priority is to take care of the well-being of its own citizens. All countries have immigration policies in place and the uncontrolled influx of immigrants into any country places immense pressure on that country's fiscus, its social services like health care, its water sources, electricity and job opportunities in particular. South Africa is in crisis when it comes to job creation because the economy is not growing due to the ANC's socialist approach to the economy and the fact that free market principles are not applied. As unemployment increases in the country, the FF Plus expects to see more xenophobic attacks because South Africa's citizens are being deprived of job opportunities. The FF Plus believes that stricter action must be taken against the illegal immigrants and that proper border control must be implemented by, among other things, eradicating corruption at border control posts and ensuring proper policing of our country's borders.
