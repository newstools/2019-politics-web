Absa Did Not Refuse to Cooperate with Public Protector 19 July 2019 Absa has taken note of the Public Protector, Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane's assertion today that her office subpoenaed Absa to provide bank account information relating to her investigation into the President. We wish to place on record that Absa is not aware of such a supboena and therefore has not refused to cooperate with her investigation. In the past 12 months, Absa has received two subpoenas from the Public Protector and has, in accordance with the law, complied with them. These subpoenas did not involve any information relating to the President. The Public Protector's assertion is therefore, refuted. Issued by Phumza Macanda on behalf of Absa, 19 July 2019
