Brooklyn police must act against refugees 14 November 2019 eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_4',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) calls on the South African Police Services (SAPS) to make urgent arrests where necessary, after learning that hundreds of refugees have now moved into the premises of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) offices in Tshwane. This comes hours after the North Gauteng High Court ruled that they must vacate the pavements they have been occupying outside the offices within three days of the serving of the notice. The refugees are demanding to be sent to other countries because they fear xenophobic attacks in South Africa. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0']));The court order against the refugees, who allegedly excrete and urinate in public, was brought by the Brooklyn and Eastern Area Citizens’ Association and the Waterkloof Homeowners’ Association. The order states that “in the event that any of the people camped outside the offices transgresses the law, state authorities are authorised to arrest them.” The North Gauteng High Court ruling sets an important precedent for the future conduct of the SAPS. The SAPS must act immediately to ensure that law and order is maintained. Issued by John Moodey,DA Gauteng Provincial Leader, 14 November 2019
