110 000 new jobs for Tshwane residents 19 November 2019 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance applauds the 110 000 EPWP jobs that have been created by the DA-led City of Tshwane during the 2019/20 financial year. Thousands of unemployed residents between the ages of 18 and 60, who registered on the cityâ€™s database between 13 August and 13 September 2019, were entered into a draw to ensure a transparent selection process. EPWP jobs are allocated to residents of the community who desperately need jobs, to give them a chance to get practical work experience, which is difficult to obtain. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));Previously under the ANC-led administration, this scheme was being used to buy political favour and jobs. When the DA-led multiparty government took office in 2016, it promised to undo the corrupted EPWP system where jobs were handed out based on nepotism and patronage. Only the DA can bring change that Builds One South Africa for All, through fair and equal access to jobs.
