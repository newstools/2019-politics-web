EFF welcomes the police arrest of Carletonville nursery school caregiver 5 April 2019 The EFF welcomes the police arrest Of the Carletonville nursery school caregiver who was filmed brutally assaulting three children enrolled at the creche. This self-hating teacher points to a dominant toxic and violent parenting style that grounds itself on the brutal abuse of children. There are many parents in our country who believe corporal punishment is central to the education of children's behaviour. Yet, it is this corporal punishment that deposits an archive Of violet in the child's leading to the stubborn phenomenon of a violent society we find so hard to overcome. Those who abused children are recognisable for the biggest human damage in society and must be condemned. Early Development Centres must monitored to ensure there is no corporal punishment or any abuse of any kind that children are subjected to. This is why the EFF commitment and plan of action in our Manifesto advocates for the need to prioritize ECDCs and professionalize them. We also call for all its teachers to be employed on a full-time basis under department of education, with decent wages. Teachers and caregivers in early development centers must be trained to deal with children and young minds. The EFF takes the education of a black child seriously, it is fundamental to the sustainability of Economic Freedom in our lifetime.
