Sakeliga attaches BLF bank account after landgrab interdict 26 February 2019 The business organisation Sakeliga has had Black First Land First’s (BLF) bank account frozen, after the BLF neglected to honour a cost order awarded against them in December of last year. The cost order originates from an interdict awarded to Sakeliga by the High Court in Pretoria, after ruling that BLF and its leaders were prohibited from inciting land grabs. “Sakeliga intends to recover R68 000 in legal costs from BLF and will be using the money to finance Landgrab911. Landgrab911 is a platform created to assist in warding off landgrabs. It empowers land owners with information, legal assistance and property records from the office of the Chief Surveyor General, so as to prepare for, or act against, illegal land occupiers,” according to Piet le Roux, Sakeliga CEO. Le Roux says it is important that extremist, fringe organisations, like BLF are not allowed to damage business and personal interests, or the public interest. “To incite land grabs is criminal behaviour and – if allowed to continue – is liable to have serious knock-on effects. For this reason, it is imperative that this type of behaviour be quashed. We take note of the fact that BLF, apparently, intended to use these funds to register for the 2019 elections, but this will not dissuade us from recovering the costs. If BLF had refrained from criminal actions, it would not have lost this money.” Issued by Moira-Marie Kloppers, Head: Media and Marketing, Sakeliga, 26 February 2019
