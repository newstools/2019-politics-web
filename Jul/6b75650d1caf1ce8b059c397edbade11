SACP’s initial response to the negative findings made by the incumbent Public Protector Adv. Busisiwe Mkhwebane against President Cyril Ramaphosa 19 July 2019 The South African Communist Party notes the negative “finding” announcement and associated “remedial action” made on Friday, 19 July 2019, by Adv. Mkhwebane against President Cyril Ramaphosa. While the SACP will access the report and evaluate it word for word in order to develop a comprehensive response, the inevitable question is whether the negative finding against the President is surprising. Not at all, because her posture indicated all along that she was destined towards a negative finding. The SACP expressed its reservations a while ago about the manner in which Adv. Mkhwebane conducts herself and the affairs of the absolutely important office of the Public Protector. The material basis of the concern is found in the damning court judgments against her. This includes the reasonable apprehension of bias, disingenuousness and unconstitutional conduct found by the court of law in her work, directly resulting in the SACP calling on Parliament to conduct an inquiry into her fitness to hold office. The SACP fully respects the legal and constitutional rights of those adversely affected, and will in this regard take its cue from the courts as the final arbiters.
