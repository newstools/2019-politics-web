Solidarity forced to take legal action against Denel 22 July 2019 Solidarity is irate after Denel informed workers that their July salary might not be paid on time. “Not paying salaries on time must be is totally unacceptable and we condemn it. The implications are immense and far-reaching and Solidarity is ready for the fight,” said Helgard Cronjé, Solidarity’s Sector Coordinator for Defence and Aviation. Denel remains confident of government’s continued support and believes it will receive the much-needed recapitalisation by the end of September 2019. “The thought that Denel cannot guarantee salaries for July is completely unacceptable to say the least. Recapitalisation alone will not solve Denel’s financial crisis. It is a short-term solution at best,” Cronjé said. If July salaries aren’t paid Solidarity will be left with no other option but to urgently proceed with legal action against Denel. “While Management’s communication to employees is more transparent and unions appreciate management’s efforts, the realities facing our members nevertheless still remain, and as a union we need to do what we need to do to protect the rights of our members,” Cronjé warned.
