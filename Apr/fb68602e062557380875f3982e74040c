Hoërskool Driehoek: Parliamentary answers indicate that Lesufi and Gauteng Department of Education 11 April 2019 The FF Plus was shocked and yet not surprised to learn, from parliamentary questions posed to the Minister of Basic Education, that infrastructure inspections at Hoërskool Driehoek were only carried out on the following dates: 8 April 2006, 20 September 2006 and 8 April 2014. The last inspection was done in July 2018 as part of an investigation to determine the capacity of the school. This makes it very clear that inspections were carried out sporadically and not at sensible intervals. What is even more shocking is that the last so-called infrastructure inspection was just part of Panyaza Lesufi, Gauteng MEC for Education's, politically motivated initiative to destroy Afrikaans schools by forcing schools that are not filled to capacity to admit learners who do not speak Afrikaans. It is also clear that the objective of the last so-called infrastructure inspection, which was to coincide with the capacity audits, was only to determine class sizes and not the structural integrity of the school. Thus, Lesufi and his Department's politicking lead to the poor maintenance of Hoërskool Driehoek. The first lot of inspections were conducted sporadically and very long ago and the objective of the last inspection was motivated purely by a political agenda and was not to ensure the safety of the school's infrastructure. The FF Plus is looking into possibly lodging criminal complaints against Lesufi and his Department. It is lamentable that ordinary people and learners had to suffer due to the ANC that does not govern for the benefit of all, but instead targets minorities to make up for their own shortcomings. The time has come to fight back and join the FF Plus on the 8th of May to overthrow the ANC and establish a coalition government with other opposition parties.
