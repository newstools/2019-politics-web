Another KZN farm attack: DA again calls on MEC Sithole-Moloi to act on Rural Safety Plan 11 December 2019 eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));Less than two months after a farm attack in the Hidcote/Middlerus area, the Democratic Alliance (DA) has been reliably informed that another incident took place last night, leaving a farm manager brutally assaulted. The information was conveyed to the DA via SAPS members and the neighbouring community.  We have also been advised that thanks to the quick response of local security company, Nsele, as well as SAPS, a vehicle has been recovered and one of the two suspects arrested. This latest act of violence is of extreme concern to the DA. We extend our best wishes for a speedy recovery to the gentleman concerned. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));Last month, the DA submitted an urgent request to KZN Agriculture MEC, Bongiwe Sithole-Moloi, requesting that she urgently convene a meeting of the portfolio committee to assess the progress made in implementing the Rural Safety Plan. This plan was to have been implemented in 2010. Since then, the DA has also written to the MEC and to the committee chairperson, requesting that they call an urgent meeting with SAPS to evaluate the Plan and how it is to be implemented and what progress has been made since 2010. Our appeal was dismissed with the MEC stating that the safety of farmers is not a mandate of her Department. Any attack on a farmer, farm worker or rural citizen is one too many and it is a crime that the MEC does not acknowledge this. Given the disdain shown by MEC Sithole-Moloi, the DA in KZN will be seeking assistance from counterparts at a national level. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));The DA's own Rural Safety Plan puts in place a number of quick response to crime and brutal attacks in rural areas. These include; Establishing a rural safety directorate within SAPS; Subsidizing a citizen band radio network; and eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_5',115,'0','0']));Introducing and funding rural safety units. The DA will today write to MEC Sithole-Moloi to request that she and her Department make funding available to support Farm watches and Farm Patrols, which are currently doing the work of an under-resourced and under-skilled SAPS. While the ANC’s so-called New Dawn has long since faded for many South Africans, the DA will continue to fight for safe rural areas.
