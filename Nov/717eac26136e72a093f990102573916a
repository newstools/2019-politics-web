Thompson received two life sentences, as well as a further 58 years and six months after he had entered into a pleading and sentencing agreement with the State. “We welcome the sentence. Thompson, who was out on bail, harassed the community over a long period of time through crime,” says Johandré van Zyl, AfriForum’s Head of Safety for the southern region. “It should be investigated why and how Thompson was released on bail. These tragic murders constitute the destruction of a whole community’s well-being, future dreams and even hope,” says Ian Cameron, AfriForum’s Head for Community Safety.
