DA is creating RSA's meanest City in Cape Town 13 December 2019 ANC Western Cape welcomes the High Court Judgement which put a stop to the DA's cold-hearted and mean-spirited approach in dealing with homeless residents in the City of Cape Town. Asking poor people to pay for being poor is profoundly immoral and reprehensible. The ANC charges the DA for the spiking in the number of homeless people in our city. In 2010 the City had about a 1000 homeless people. Today that number is over 8000. That is almost a thousand people added into the unforgiving world of the homeless every year. This is an indictment to the Democratic Alliance but an inevitable part of their crass and crude policies. The ANC has already dealt with DA Councillors like Shayne Ramsay, who wrote on Facebook that, 'homeless people are retarded vagrants and social outcasts who must be treated with cruelty in order to discourage them from choosing homelessness and for choosing Sea Point as their base' which the DA has always sought to distance itself from as opinions of an individual. It's clear to the ANC now that this is the view of the DA as a party on the homeless and the poor residents of our city. The ANC has always been clear, along with the UNCHS that the best way to deal with homelessness is to avoid people becoming homeless in the first place. The ANC asks the DA as both the provincial and City Government to deal with the critical issues that causes homelessness, lack of housing‚ substance abuse, unemployment‚ lack of planning for rural to urban migration and mental illness. The High Court Judgement helps to remind the DA that it cannot whip people out of homelessness. The DA must deal with the root causes of homelessness.
