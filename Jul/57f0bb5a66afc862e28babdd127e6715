AfriForum welcomes court judgement against Julius Malema 4 July 2019 The civil rights organisation AfriForum welcomes the judgement by the Northern Gauteng High Court earlier today to dismiss the application by Julius Malema, Leader of the EFF, which involves declaring the Riotous Assemblies Act, 1956 (Act No. 17 of 1956) as unconstitutional. Malema has in the past found himself in hot water seeing as he evidently on various occasions incited members of his own party, as well as residents of the country to make themselves guilty of criminal activities, among which incitement to occupy land unlawfully. Section 18(2)(b) of the abovementioned Act determines that this action is a crime in itself. “AfriForum is delighted about the judgement and will take care that justice prevails if Malema and the EFF make suchlike ill-judged and irresponsible judgements. Malema is one of those people in a position of power that threatens the safety and rights of citizens by means of reckless power games,” says Ian Cameron, AfriForum’s Head of Community Safety. AfriForum is currently busy with various similar cases against the EFF and Malema. Issued by Carina Bester, Media Relations Officer, AfriForum, 4 July 2019
