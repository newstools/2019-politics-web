Ramaphosa’s ‘political backers’ fall due to corruption 17 January 2019 The DA welcomes today's media reports that raids were conducted on the homes of individuals linked to the multi-million-rand North Sea Jazz graft scandal, one of whom is ANC KZN deputy Chairperson and Ramaphosa enforcer, Mike Mabuyakhulu. It is a good day in the fight against ANC corruption and the abuse of state resources to benefit a connected few at the expense of people oppressed by poverty. Reports indicate that properties and cars worth R12 million were attached. Nothing has changed in Rampahosa’s ANC and his much vaunted ‘New Dawn’. The same failing ANC which enabled Zuma’s disgraced Presidency are still embedded in the system and occupy high positions in the ANC. The ANC remains a broken bus, it just has a driver. Mabuyakhulu has remained a benefactor of political largesse, through top government jobs, under both Ramaphosa and Zuma. The DA will keep a close eye on this case to ensure that state resources are not abused in litigation by all those implicated, especially with the ongoing factional wars between Mabuyakhulu and Sihle Zikalala. The failing ANC has proven time and again that it is not fit to govern. South Africans are faced with a unique opportunity to register in their numbers and vote the failing ANC out resoundingly. The DA is the only party that can bring change that delivers and turn the tide of lawlessness and looting in KZN. It is time that people of KZN give the DA a chance to foster transparent and accountable governance. The DA has a proven track record of enforcing clean governance and transparency where we govern for the building of a One South Africa for All.
