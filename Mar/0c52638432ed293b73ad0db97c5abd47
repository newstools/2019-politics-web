Apology by MEC Mazibuko to the people of Gauteng 14 March 2019 I, Faith Mazibuko, Member of the Executive (MEC) responsible for Sport, Arts, Culture and Recreation in Gauteng profusely apologise to the people of Gauteng, as a result of the widely circulated audio recording of myself concerning a meeting I held with senior managers, on February 15, 2019. After deep personal reflections, I want to unreservedly apologise for the tone and improper language I used towards my Head ofÂ Department (HOD) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO). I'm a firm believer of women empowerment, irrespective of race and sexual orientation, because women under Apartheid suffered what we came to understand as triple oppression. I will continue to work hard to build a non-racial and non-sexist society. These are the ideals I will continue to champion and uphold whether in government or elsewhere as an ordinary member of society. I humble myself and apologise to Premier Makhura and my colleagues in the provincial Cabinet for the harm caused. I am willing to subject myself to whatever appropriate sanction to be imposed on me by Premier Makhura and my organisation, the ANC. Issued by Nomazwe Ntlokwana on behalf of Gauteng Government, 14 March 2019
