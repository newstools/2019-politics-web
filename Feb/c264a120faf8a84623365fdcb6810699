727 Children still waiting for foster placement in Gauteng 25 February 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng is concerned that there are at least 727 children waiting for foster care placement in Gauteng. Some of these children have been on the waiting list for almost three years. The Department of Social Development is failing to expedite the placement of the most vulnerable members of society who are in desperate need of a safe place to stay. If this department was serious about ensuring the safety and welfare of our children, they would have placed these children by now. This is a clear indication that the failing ANC-led government in Gauteng cares little about the welfare of our poor people and that they can no longer be trusted in governing this province. The children who are still on the waiting list, do not have access to the money that is meant to take care of them and their needs as a result of the incompetence of this department. It is high time that the people of Gauteng are given a government that cares about their needs and prioritises the plight of the most vulnerable in our society. We will continue to put pressure on the MEC for Social Development, Nandi Mayathula-Khoza to ensure that these children are placed into foster care as a matter of urgency.
