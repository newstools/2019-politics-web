Sasol-Khanyisa: CCMA gives Solidarity green light to go to court 19 February 2019 Trade union Solidarity today announced that the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) granted a certificate giving the trade union the right to fight the exclusion of white workers from Sasol’s Khanyisa Employee Share Scheme in the Labour Court. According to Anton van der Bijl, head of Labour Legal Services at Solidarity, the trade union will ask the Labour Court to come to the finding that Sasol’s employee share scheme excludes a particular group of workers based on their race and that this amounts to unfair racial discrimination. Solidarity requests that Sasol should include all employees, irrespective of their race, in the employee share scheme, or that it should provide similar benefits to the employees who are currently excluded. “We will not stop fighting this battle. We cannot be so blinded by the past that we abandon the future of equal opportunities for all,” Van der Bijl said. “Our legal team is already finalising the court documents and we will be ready to go to the Labour Court at the end of February,” Van der Bijl concluded.
