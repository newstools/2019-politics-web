Solidarity and AfriForum announces further action against Molefe 12 August 2019 Solidarity and AfriForum will announce comprehensive steps it’s planning to take, to bring Brian Molefe, former Chief Executive of Eskom to account, this coming Tuesday. These steps include among other things, possible private prosecution by advocate Gerrie Nel from AfriForum’s Private Prosecution Unit. Further steps include the possible seizure of Molefe’s assets. The details around these steps will be revealed by advocate Gerrie Nel and Solidarity during a media conference on 13 August 2019. These steps follow due to the National Prosecuting Authority’s (NPA) lack to begin with prosecution, following the criminal complaint Solidarity lodged against Molefe. “Through this action against Molefe, Solidarity wants to contribute to a culture of accountability in South Africa. We cannot allow tax looters to simply get away,” said Dr Dirk Hermann, Chief Operations Officer (COO) of Solidarity. After the recent ruling in the Constitutional Court against Molefe, Solidarity immediately started taking steps to recover the cost order and to ensure that the R10 million Molefe looted from the Eskom pension fund is reimbursed. A warrant has already been issued and Solidarity is awaiting the sheriff’s instruction. Issued by Alexa Reinecke, Communication Manager, Solidarity, 12 August 2019
