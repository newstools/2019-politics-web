Phahlane’s arrest a victory for justice – but heralds no new dawn 1 March 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes the news that former National Police Commissioner, Lt Gen Kgomotso Phahlane, has finally been arrested on charges of fraud. The DA believes that the serious allegations and prima facie evidence against Phahlane represent the rot and corruption that have become endemic in the South African Police Service (SAPS) under a failing ANC government. Although Phahlane may soon finally be made to pay his dues, this arrest by no means heralds a new dawn in the police service. The fact is that for years it has been the mission of former IPID Executive Director, Robert McBride, to ensure that this day arrives. But just yesterday, the ANC members of the Police Portfolio Committee, toeing the Minister's line and thus effectively protecting corrupt elements in police management, endorsed Police Minister Cele's "preliminary decision" not to renew McBride’s contract. The DA has long supported McBride’s efforts to see justice done in the Phahlane matter. In 2017, it was as a result of our efforts that a forensic report detailing corruption and maladministration dating from Phahlane’s days at the head of the SAPS’ forensic services division saw the light. When the DA comes into national government we will overhaul the SAPS to become an honest and professional police service that actually serves and protects South Africans.  We will fight corruption in the police service because we believe that building one South Africa for all means that nobody should be above the law.
