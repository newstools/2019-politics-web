Gauteng Schools still without textbooks or desks 28 February 2019 The Gauteng Education Department is currently facing the challenge of ensuring that all schools within the province receive the required textbooks and desks for effective learning to take place. In a reply to DA questions at the Legislature, there are currently more than 40 schools that have still not received textbooks for their learners. Also, over 200 schools are still in desperate need of school furniture such as desks and chairs. Unfortunately, this has been the norm under the ANC-led Gauteng government. Schools have been stretched to maximum capacity, and in certain areas even over-capacitated without any meaningful investment in resources such as textbooks, furniture or infrastructure. Education MEC Lesufi has promised that all these resource shortages will be addressed and resolved by the end of the first term of 2019. We have heard such promises before, and judging from the ANC’s track record, the DA is not convinced that these issues will be resolved in time. However, we will keep a close eye on the Gauteng Department of Education’s progress in meeting its own deadline. Education still remains a vital pillar that can bring about a brighter future for our young learners. The DA is the only party that can unseat the ANC and bring about meaningful change to this province. Our visits to schools will continue so as to ensure that learning and teaching takes place in a conducive environment that ensures leaners get the best access to quality education.
