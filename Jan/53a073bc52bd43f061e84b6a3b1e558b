Alleged acceptance of a bribe by the former leader of the NUM 16 January 2019 The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) PWV Region takes note of Mr. Angelo Agrizzi's testimony at Zondo's State of the Capture Commission of Enquiry regarding money that our former Kloof Branch Chairperson the late Jackson Mafika is alleged to have received from Bosasa pertaining to tender processes. NUM will request copies of the statement made by Mr. Agrizzi at the commission and will take things from there. It is unfortunate that Jackson Mafika who is mentioned in Zondo' Commission passed on in 2013 and cannot respond to allegations leveled against him at this Commission. "NUM would, however, like to make it clear that it does not support fraud and corruption of any kind. We are following the evidence led by Mr. Agrizzi closely and will determine as to what an extent is NUM implicated and whether there is any step we need to take to protect its name and integrity," said Ndlela Radebe, NUM PWV Chairperson.
