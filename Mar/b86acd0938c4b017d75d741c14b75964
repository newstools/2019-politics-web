Cancelled summonses and suspended legal actions concerning e-toll shows sheer desperation of ANC in Gauteng 28 March 2019 SANRAL's announcement that all the summonses and legal actions concerning e-toll will be suspended is clearly a politically motivated decision that only goes to show how desperate the ANC is not to lose any more support in the province before the elections in May. The FF Plus, along with all motorists, is overjoyed by the news. It indicates that the ANC government has finally come to the realisation that the e-toll system has no legitimacy, just like the FF Plus has been saying all along. The ANC's support in Gauteng has probably dropped to far below 50% and this decision proves that the ANC is afraid that it might lose even more support. The FF Plus has been fighting against e-toll for years now and was the very first party to draw up a petition against e-toll, which got more than 100 000 signatures. The party was also a member of the Toll-gate Action Group (TAG) that tried to put a stop to the system in court. The party demands that all the legal expenses incurred by TAG, consisting of the FF Plus, the Transvaal Agricultural Union of South Africa (TAU SA) and the National Taxpayers Union (NTU), in trying to put an end to e-toll must be paid by the state. This includes all other expenses incurred by other parties and OUTA in the fight against e-toll seeing as it is wasted expenditure that the state forced them to incur.
