HRC must investigate shocking racist remarks after bridge tragedy at Hoërskool Driehoek in Vanderbijlpark The tragedy at Hoërskool Driehoek in Vanderbijlpark in which three children lost their lives when a walkway collapsed took a shocking racist turn and the FF Plus insists that the HRC must investigate the incident with the same fervour as the other recent incidents where white people were accused of racism. After the incident, one Siyanda Dizzy Gumede posted the following on Facebook (verbatim): “Dont have heart to feel pain for white kids. Minus 3 future problems”. Another person, one Sam Moon, commented on the post by saying: “Minus 3 land criminals, great news”. What makes these statements even worse is that it is absolutely heartless commentary on an incident in which children died in a gruesome way. The HRC must know that the FF Plus will keep a close eye on the steps it takes to ensure that these statements are properly investigated and with the same urgency as the cases where white people were accused of racism. In these cases, the HRC did not hesitate to take action publicly and to get involved directly by responding to the offenders. This is clear evidence that racial tension is on the rise in the South African community because an organisation like the HRC apparently does not care to take action when a public figure, like Julius Malema, openly incites violence against white people. The FF Plus will no longer stand idly by and watch as selective action against racism becomes the norm in South Africa. It is in the best interest of all South Africans that action must be taken, without bias, against any person who is guilty of racism. Statement issued by Adv. Anton Alberts, FF Plus chairperson, 1 February 2019
