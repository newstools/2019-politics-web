Mangaung Metro pays Glad Africa R282 770 371 for ghost services 13 September 2019 Over a period of five years the Mangaung Metro has paid Glad Africa an estimated R282 770 371 for consultation and construction fees for projects related to the Integrated Public Transport Network (IPTN). According to the Auditor General’s (AG) report on the 9th of July 2019, the Mangaung Metro Municipality has spent over R435 653 265 since the commencement of the project. According the AG, this money was spent on planning, feasibility studies and the initial stages of the ITPN. In the same report he points out that phase two of the project “has been delayed due to a lack of resources”. However, if one drives around the Metro it is evident that the IPTN process is still in its initial stages and one can not help but wonder what exactly this money had been spent on. The response by the Metro's Municipal Manager, Advocate Tankiso Mea, to questions asked by the DA's Councillor Rossouw Botes was vague and unclear. In one of his responses he stated that IPTN falls directly under him, yet he was not able to give clear details about the tender. His vagueness is disturbing and unsettling. If the R282 770 371 was paid for construction fees, what construction has taken place for IPTN? Since there is no evident IPTN construction, has Glad Africa been paid for services yet to be rendered? As the official opposition in the Metro, the DA's mandate is to hold the ruling party accountable for mismanagement. The DA will continue to expose maladministration by the cash-strapped ANC-led municipality. We will also further investigate this matter to get to the truth. It seems that Mangaung Metro uses the people's money to pay for services yet to be rendered and not services rendered while there is a dire need in the municipality for icreased and efficient basic services.
