No intervention will solve unemployment problem under current ANC policy 22 August 2019 The so-called interventions to relieve unemployment in South Africa that President Cyril Ramaphosa referred to during a parliamentary question and answer session today will not succeed under the current ANC policy directions. The President admits that the unemployment problem is the biggest challenge that South Africa is facing at present, but the ANC government is stubbornly forging ahead on this road heading to disaster, which is paved with its thoughtless and self-serving policy. The President wants to promote investor confidence, but his government is insisting on jeopardising private ownership with its policy. Furthermore, the government expects the private sector to stimulate job creation, but restrictive and prescriptive labour legislation is preventing the private sector from doing just that. Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) and Affirmative Action (AA) are just a few examples of government interference that prevents job creation by the private sector. The interventions that the government should rather focus on include relaxing restrictive labour legislation and overregulation, a turn-around strategy for local government to restore proper service delivery and combating corruption and theft effectively by putting a stop to cadre deployment. The President is quite right, unemployment is a national disaster of epic proportions. It is, however, a disaster brought about and furthered by his very own government and things will not change as long as this same government remains in power.
