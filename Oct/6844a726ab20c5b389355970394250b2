'Demonic' matric artworks: DA calls on concerned parents to report to the CRL 22 October 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) has today called on concerned parents at an exclusive Independent School in the Richard’s Bay area to refer their complaints to the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, religious and Linguistic Communities (CRL) after the emergence of a video clip depicting demonic images as part of the matric art exhibition.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0'])); The DA was made aware of this situation by one of our own local Councillors, Henning de Wet. In the clip, a parent is seen expressing his outrage and disappointment while filming part of the exhibition which includes Jesus and his disciples depicted as clowns, various images of the devil, torn pages of the Bible, replicas of human skulls and other. The video has since gone viral. While the DA’s oversight of Independent Schools is limited in terms of legislation, there can be no denying that the images within the clip are deeply disturbing. Equally alarming is that they are within the walls of a school with a strong Christian ethos. There is, however the South African Bill of Rights, which must be respected. Notwithstanding, it must also be remembered that the freedom of expression, which is an inalienable right in the same Bill, is not without limitations and responsibilities related to such freedoms.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0'])); The DA belives that the CRL is well placed to opine in this matter. The DA has already raised this matter with KZN’s Education MEC, Khwazi Mshengu, so that he can exercise his Executive authority - together with his HOD - to get to the bottom of the matter.
