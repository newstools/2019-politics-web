To curb road deaths requires back to basics approach in Dept of Transport 18 June 2019 The IFP extends its heartfelt condolences to the friends, family and loved ones following the death of 24 people, who died in a road accident on the R81 in Maphalle, Limpopo. This tragedy did not take place in isolation as many more lives were lost on our roads this past long-weekend. The IFP firmly believes that in order to curb road deaths, the Department of Transport led by Minister Fikile Mbalula must return to the fundamental principles of road traffic management. A back to basics approach is required to address the root causes of accidents on our roads. The lack of driver education, driver well-being and law enforcement have over the past few years been wanting. We believe that learner driving in schools must form part of life orientation within the school curriculum and it will also serve to prepare our young people for skills and jobs of the future. Furthermore, random sampling for re-testing of existing driver’s licenses on the basis of a lottery system would also ensure that drivers are always aware and up to speed with their road rules and driving abilities. Indeed, The IFP challenges the taxi and bus industry for greater training of drivers and stricter measures for the issuing of PDPs to drivers. The for profit-driving industry should be mindful of their role on the roads and those who they transport. The IFP will in the 6th Parliament constructively hold this department accountable and provide solutions where possible. By KP Sithole, IFP Spokesperson on Transport, 18 June 2019
