Cape Town voted the world’s top tourist city…again 25 November 2019 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_6',112,'0','0']));Over 39 000 Telegraph readers have confirmed, for the seventh time, that Cape Town is the best city to visit. This is yet another feather in our cap. Cape Town trumped Vancouver in second spot and Kyoto, Japan in third place. Accolades like these do not simply fall out of the sky. The fact that thousands of travellers have voted Cape Town as the best city to visit is as a result of the hard work delivered by the City’s Place Marketing team and our destination marketing partner, Cape Town Tourism. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_5',113,'0','0']));Our city has so much to offer for everyone, no matter what you are looking for. We have diverse cultural and heritage experiences that give us the opportunity to take a new immersive approach to cultural tourism, giving tourists even more to explore. By focussing on creating more community-based offerings, while promoting the already impressive sites and attractions Cape Town has to offer, I intend to make tourism a game-changer for our city. My team and I have been hard at work on the new exciting Tourism Development Framework (TDF) that was recently adopted by Council. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_7',114,'0','0']));My immediate priority is to ensure the efficient implementation of the TDF so that we boost cultural experiences and help diversify tourism products. This will translate into more involvement from specific communities who will be able benefit from the millions of visitors we have every year.
