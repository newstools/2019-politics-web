ANC refuses to answer on Esidimeni, violent crime and e-tolls 17 September 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) condemns the ANC in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature who refused to give account today in respect of Life Esidimeni, violent crime and e-tolls. The DA had tabled two motions to be debated, one motion was on the payment of compensation to the families of the victims of the Life Esidimeni and the second motion on violent crime in Gauteng’s rural communities. We had also tabled an oral e-toll question to the Premier with regards to the progress in terms of the work done so far by the inter-ministerial task team on e-tolls. These two motions were meant to be debated on 3 September 2019 however, the sitting was cancelled due to the violence and looting that was taking place in the Joburg CBD.eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0', 0])); It was communicated that the programme of that Sitting will be moved to the next Sitting date which is today. Instead of continuing with the programme as planned, the ANC decided to postpone our motions and oral question to the Premier saying that today’s Sitting clashes with the NCOP week. This is just another delay tactic by the ANC which is dodging accountability on the most crucial issues that are affecting our residents.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2',114,'0', 0])); Our people deserve to know the future of e-tolls, why the people who were most to blame for the loss of 144 lives have not faced any punitive action whatsoever, as well as how this government plans to tackle violent crime. - The question on e-tolls that the Premier did not want to answer; - The motion on Life Esidimeni which the ANC blocked accountability by Qedani Mahlangu; - The motion on violent crime which the ANC refused to debate. We will ensure that the Gauteng Legislature performs its function of holding the executive to account and through the legislative mechanisms at our disposal these important issues will not fall off the people’s agenda.
