Parliament to Hold Police Minister Accountable for Stanger Crime Crisis 28 February 2019 The Democratic Alliance in KZN welcomes the decision by the National Assembly Speaker, Baleka Mbete to refer our petition regarding the inaction of the Police Minister  Bheki Cele surrounding the Stanger crime crisis after the DA revealed the shocking conviction rate for murder, rape and robbery was just 1,4% and 0% for hijacking. The DA has fought a long battle to bring justice for the residents of Stanger and at each and every turn, the Minister has refused to come to the table through formal meeting requests and march held on 18 November 2018 at the KwaDukuza Police Station. The time has come for Parliament to hold the AWOL Minister accountable for his inaction and insensitive behaviour towards the residents of Stanger. We will be closely monitoring the progress of the investigation by the committee in the hope that we can find solutions for the residents of Stanger. Ultimately, the Police Minister must answer for his inaction over this saga and explain why he has chosen to ignore the people of Stanger. It is only the DA that is prepared to fight for safer communities and which has the strength and willingness to hold the ANC accountable.
