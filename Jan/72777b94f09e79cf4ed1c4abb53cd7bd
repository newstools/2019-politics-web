Zille wants to tax the Western Cape 28 January 2019 Helen Zille is once again showing her political duplicity by on the one hand advocating a national tax boycott and, on the other, wanting to change the Western Cape Constitution so that the province can collect taxes. Should Zille’s plans go ahead, Western Cape residents will face a double tax bill: one from national government and one from the Western Cape. “I find it hypocritical that a person who wants to advocate the non-payment of taxes is also planning do hit the Western Cape with a tax whammy,” said Khaya Magaxa, the Leader of the Opposition and acting ANC chairperson in the Western Cape in a statement. “The Zille tax will place an extra tax burden on people. If she’s so principled, why doesn’t she drop her plans? Given her view on tax would she object if taxpayers were to say ‘we’re not paying Zille’s tax’.” Zille’s tax amendment, which if passed will allow the Western Cape to levy provincial taxes, levies, duties or surcharges falls under a raft of proposed changes to the provincial constitution. The Draft Bill will be discussed in the legislature tomorrow at 11am. “We call on all people in the Western Cape to rise up against the Zille tax. We call on our people to join us in telling her “No, Zille”. We demand that she personally attends the committee where the issue will be dealt with today to explain herself,” Magaxa said. He also challenged DA provincial leader Bonginkozi Madikizela and its Premier candidate Allan Winde to state categorically if they were in support of proposed Zille’s taxes.
