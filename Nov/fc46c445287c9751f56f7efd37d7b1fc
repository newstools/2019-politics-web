Poor infrastructure can not withstand storm damage - DA calls for government action 25 November 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in eThekwini has written to the Head of the Department of the Disaster Management Unit, Vincent Ngubane, and the Acting Housing Head Lawrence Pato calling for their urgent intervention in the poor state of RDP houses in Kingsburgh, which endangered the lives of residents during KZN’s hazardous weather. This follows our oversight inspection in eThekwini’s ward 109 last week. According to one family in the area, they have been asking for assistance for the past five years regarding the state of their RDP house, which could collapse at any time. They have been asking for assistance from ANC councillors - from the former ward councillor Thami Magubane to the current councillor Menzi Manqele - to no avail. This is not the only family affected and the condition of these RDP houses and residents in this area live in fear of the current weather conditions. Over the past few days, the province of KwaZulu-Natal has been rocked by heavy rainfalls accompanied by storms which have brought damage throughout the province and led to a loss of lives. We are sending our heartfelt condolences to the families who lost their loved ones. It is the government’s duty to ensure that infrastructure is able to withstand these conditions. In KZN which is familiar with these weather conditions, one would think that the government would come up with decisive actions and work around the clock to ensure that residents are safe during these conditions. It is disappointing to note that our infrastructure still leaves much to be desired. We have over the years been communicating with the municipality to fix poor drainage systems but our calls have fallen on deaf ears.
