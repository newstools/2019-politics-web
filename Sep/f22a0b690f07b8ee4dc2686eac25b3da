MEC Albert Fritz condemns unlawful and violent protest action 27 September 2019 The Minister of Community Safety, Albert Fritz, has condemned the unlawful and violent protest action taking place along the N7, Milnerton which includes Dunoon. The protests are reportedly taxi-related, the demands of which are unclear. Minister Fritz has called for calm and urged caution to those passing through or residing within the immediate community and affected areas. Residents have reported the burning of tires in streets and rocks being thrown through car windows. Minister Fritz said, “The destruction of personal property and the endangering of lives is to be condemned in the strongest terms. While citizens have the right to protest and freedom of assembly, any protest action which is violent and unlawful is to be condemned in the strongest terms. I call for immediate calm and stabilisation within affected communities.” Minister Fritz further added, “I would like to commend the SAPS Public Order Police, Metro Police, traffic officials, local Neighbourhood Watches and Community Policing Forums for their efforts to bring stability to the affected communities. I further call on anyone with any information to report such to their local SAPS on 08600 10111. Vulnerable communities should not be held hostage by the few who seek to destabilise it.” Under the leadership of Minister Fritz, the Department of Community Safety will continue to support organisations which safeguard residents in the Western Cape.
