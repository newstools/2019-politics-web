AfriForum satisfied that Duduzane had his day in court Duduzane Zuma, son of former president Jacob Zuma, was found not guilty today in the Randburg Magistrate’s Court in the prosecution case for culpable homicide and reckless and negligent driving. “AfriForum’s aim was to make sure that Zuma Jr stated his case in a court for judgment, just as any other citizen against whom a prima facie case exists. AfriForum achieved this goal and abides by the court’s decision,” says Elias Maangwale, Investigator at AfriForum’s Private Prosecution Unit. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) initially decided not to prosecute Zuma Jr in connection with a vehicle accident on 1 February 2014 on the M1 highway in Gauteng – in which Phumzile Mekelina Dube, a young female passenger, died on impact. After AfriForum’s Private Prosecution Unit applied to prosecute Zuma Jr privately, the NPA however overturned its initial decision and instituted prosecution.
