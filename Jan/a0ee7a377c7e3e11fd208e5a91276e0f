AfriForum wins land grab court case with Malema’s money 21 January 2019 AfriForum was victorious in the Northern Gauteng High Court today against illegal land invaders and the South African Police Service (SAPS). The victory follows an urgent application to force the SAPS to remove land invaders who illegally occupied land in the De Wildt area in the North West. The legal cost for the application is paid from funds that were paid to AfriForum by Julius Malema and the EFF after they had lost numerous cases to AfriForum with cost. One of these cases incidentally involved Malema’s public incitement to occupy land illegally. “Apart from the irony that it is Malema who is, so to speak, now paying to bring land invaders to book, this is another victory for AfriForum in its battle to protect property rights in South Africa and to force the SAPS to assist the rightful landowners in protecting their properties,” says Ian Cameron, AfriForum’s Head of Community Safety. “AfriForum has been working with the specific community for the past three weeks in a bid to convince the SAPS to protect the rightful owners’ rights, but we were compelled to approach the court because the SAPS refused to open cases of trespassing to assist the rightful owners,” says Marnus Kamfer, Legal and Risk Manager at AfriForum.
