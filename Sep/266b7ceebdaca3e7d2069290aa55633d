DA calls for action to be taken against Gautrain Executive Communication Manager Barbara Jensen 29 September 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng calls on the Gautrain Management Agency to take a decisive action against its Executive Manager for Communications, Barbara Jensen for her irresponsible utterances in the public space. This follows the cutting of the water supply by the City of Joburg at the Gautrain Station in Sandton due to a non-payment of R8 million owed by the landlord for water, refuse and property rates. Jensen has been irresponsible in her comments about the issue. Instead of dealing with their landlord to ensure that they pay the money owed to the City of Joburg she continues to play a blame game.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0'])); Jansen is quoted in the media criticizing the City of Joburg: “I just think that it is very unfair of the city trying to keep a law-abiding, utility paying third party at ransom,” eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));“Cutting off water to an innocent service paying third party like Gautrain is not a way to solve legal matters and does not do the image of Joburg as a world-class African city any good,” She insists that Gautrain does not owe any money to the City of Joburg and that the battle is between the landlord and City of Joburg, that it has nothing to do with Gautrain. This matter does involve Gautrain as it pays the landlord for the use of their land. Gautrain could have engaged with their landlord to ensure that they pay for their utilities. They could even enter into an arrangement with the Council to pay off the debt and deduct the amounts from the rent they pay to Cedar Park Properties. Jansen must not be allowed to drag the City of Joburg’s image through the mud as the City is doing its best to ensure that they collect all debts owed to them to be able to render better services to Johannesburg residents. The Gautrain Management Authority, like any responsible government entity, should support efforts to ensure governments are sustainable.
