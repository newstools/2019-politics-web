Portfolio Committee Chairperson notes resignation of SAPO CEO, Mr Barnes 1 August 2019 The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Communications, Mr Hope Papo, on behalf of the Committee, has noted a media statement by the South African Post Office (SAPO) which announced mutual separation with the Chief Executive Officer, Mr Mark Barnes. The Chairperson also noted and welcomed the appointment of SAPO Group COO, Ms Lindiwe Kwele as the interim CEO. Mr Papo believes that Mr Barnes played a critical role of ensuring that SAPO discharge its legislative mandate in the face of serious financial challenges, amongst others caused by the global decline in mail volumes. “Under Mr Barnes’ management SAPO presented a compelling case for government to pay social grants through the Post Bank, a move which was endorsed and implemented by Cabinet. “On behalf of the committee, I would like to wish Mr Barnes success in his future endeavours,” said Mr Papo. The Portfolio Committee will use the opportunity at one of its scheduled meetings with the Department in the next term of Parliament (starting on the 20th August 2019) to get more information and determine a way forward.
