Almost 70% of PRASA-controlled train stations do not have CCTV cameras 16 September 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) can reveal that almost 70% of PRASA controlled train stations do not have CCTV cameras. A response to a DA Parliamentary Question has revealed that of the 585 train stations under PRASA’s control, only 181 stations have at least one CCTV camera. This means that only 30.9% of stations in the country have at least one CCTV cameras.eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0', 0])); In the Western Cape, where rail safety has been particularly out of hand, only 42 out of 122 stations in the province have CCTV cameras. This means only 34.4% of the province’s stations have at least one CCTV camera. These are alarming figures considering the fact that crime is on the increase. In 2018 alone, an estimated 495 people lost their lives while making use of our trains and 2079 were injured. Clearly the ANC government cannot be trusted to keep commuters safe. To make matters worse, around 26.8% of all the cameras installed nationally are not working.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0', 0])); How can we have effective policing at train stations when most stations do not have cameras, and those that do are not guaranteed to have operational ones? PRASA’s old, outdated and stoic infrastructure places many commuters across the country under constant threat of being attacked by criminals, due to the state of lawlessness and lack of law enforcement at PRASA stations. The table below shows a total of installed CCTV cameras at PRASA managed railway stations per region:eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2',114,'0', 0]));  The DA is of the view that policing and train services should be handed over to competent provinces such as the Western Cape, as the national government is incapable and clearly unwilling to keep our people safe. Unlike the ANC, the DA has a rail plan that will create a safe and well-managed railway system which put commuters first and will ensure job security. The plan is based on four aspects:eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_3',115,'0', 0])); - Stabilising and modernising the current rail system; - Merging Transnet and PRASA under the Department of Transport; - Ceding control of Metrorail services to Metros; and, - Diversifying Ownership. Poor railway infrastructure and mismanagement makes it hard for South Africans to reliably depend on trains to deliver them to their destinations safely and on time.eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-banner-1','ezslot_4',116,'0', 0])); The DA is committed to empowering South African public transport commuters and ensuring that the rail transportation system puts the safety of South Africans first.
