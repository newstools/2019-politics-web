South African sport will follow in the footsteps of SAA, Eskom due to ANC interference The Sport and Recreation Amendment Bill that was published last week is nothing but an attempt by the ANC government to nationalise sport and thus promote the party's ideology at the expense of the country. The ANC has repeatedly shown that it is unable to manage or govern the country, its institutions, its municipalities and other entities properly.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_5',112,'0','0'])); Eskom, the SAA, the SABC and Prasa are but a few examples and organised sport will soon follow suit if the Bill is adopted in its current form. This year, organised sport has once again shown that interference from the government is not necessary. If the right people, who are experts in their field, are appointed in the right positions, all will go well with South African sport. The Springboks’ World Cup victory lead by Rassie Erasmus and Siya Kolisi speaks for itself. Government interference will inevitably jeopardise South African athletes and sports teams' participation in international competitions, like the Olympic Games.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_6',113,'0','0'])); The FF Plus will oppose this Amendment Bill in every possible way.
