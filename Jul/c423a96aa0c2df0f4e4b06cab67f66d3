DA welcomes SIU investigation into Free State Department of Health procurement contracts 16 July 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes the promulgation in the Government Gazette on 12 July 2019 of the Special Investigating Unit’s (SIU) investigation into the Free State Health Department’s contract for procurement of aero-medical services and patient transport services (attached here). The DA took the matter to the Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, on 3 July 2018 to investigate three controversial contracts the Provincial Department of Health entered into with Buthelezi EMS, Mediosa and Halo Aviation. The DA is of the opinion that these contracts were awarded due to political considerations, that they are inflated, and that there is no real value for money. We pointed out several irregularities such as that the company registration details of each contractor either laid dormant, or were established just prior to the awarding of these contracts; the DA is of the opinion that the Halo Aviation contract, in joint venture with Buthelezi EMS for emergency air transportation of patients are extremely inflated. The DA also finds it irregular that under a contract for medical air transportation services, the same company will also refurbish or construct new infrastructure to support this service, a function which lies with the Department of Public Works and Infrastructure. We trust that the SIU’s investigation will reveal the depth of corruption and look forward to the outcome. We trust that justice will prevail. The DA will continue to hold the MEC and Department of Health to account in the interest of the people of the Free State.
