DA raises R10 billion to boost jobs in Tshwane 18 September 2019 The DA-led City of Tshwane has secured R10 billion through its Inaugural Trade and Investment Summit (TTIS), which will be used to create 6700 jobs through 10 different projects. The purpose of this entire initiative is to uplift the lives of the people of Tshwane. This proves the DA's commitment to building a South Africa, where there is a job in every home. One of the key projects it will finance is the Rankuwa Smart City Development, which is expected to create more than 4 161 jobs during the development phase and 222 permanent jobs on completion and support the development of more than 5 742 affordable housing units and retail facilities in the area. Since the DA took over administration of Tshwane three years ago, it has become a preferred business destination by attracting billions in investments. Where the Democratic Alliance (DA) governs we turn the tide on jobs. As the rest of South Africa faces an ongoing decline, DA-led governments are doing all they can to tackle unemployment. Only the DA can bring change that builds One South Africa for All. Issued by John Moodey, DA Gauteng Provincial Leader, 18 September 2019
