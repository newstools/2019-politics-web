COSATU condemns the intransigent employers who are threatening workers and forcing them to go to work tomorrow instead of voting in National General Elections 7 May 2019 The Congress of South African Trade Unions has noted with deep concern the numerous reports from workers that some employers are forcing them o go to work instead of voting tomorrow. We condemn all those intransigent employers who are victimising workers and reiterate our condemnation of the government’s failure to declare Elections Day a non-trading holiday. The federation is encouraging all workers who are being victimised to report to COSATU Offices and those of our affiliated trade unions. Many freedom fighters, workers, in particular, lost their lives to earn this right to vote and we should not allow some few gluttonous and arrogant employers to spit in their graves. COSATU is challenging Business Unity South Africa to condemn all those businesses that are intimidating workers. BUSA should make a public statement to the effect that all workers have a right to vote on elections day -08 May 2019.
