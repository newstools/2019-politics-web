DA Youth committed to find lasting solutions to youth unemployment 9 September 2019 Yesterday, the Democratic Alliance Youth Management Committee spearheaded by DA Youth Federal Leader, Luyolo Mphithi, visited the North West to discuss the challenges that the youth in the North West and South Africa face. Young people face many challenges which include high youth unemployment, a poor education system, drug abuse, crime and limited access to higher learning education. According to Statistics SA, youth unemployment in South Africa sits at a staggering 55.2%, and in the North West alone youth unemployment is at 40.3%. The North West has the highest number of youths in South Africa who are not in employment, education or engaging in training programmes. The DA Youth is committed to finding workable and long-lasting solutions that will bring change to the lives of young people in the province. The DA will introduce a Voluntary National Service with one year of income and skills development for school leavers. This will help young people to breach the gap, gain work experience and become more employable. Due to the high cost related to job seeking, the DA will create job centres throughout South Africa to provide information, advice and free internet to job-seekers. Where the DA governs in the City of Johannesburg, we have opened Opportunity Centres to support economic growth and develop Small, Medium and Micro Enterprise Businesses (SMMEs). These centres offer tax and advisory services to companies. The centres also host meetings, and offer internet and advice to existing and upcoming businesses. South Africa’s future is depended on young South Africans who are empowered through training, employment, education and business opportunities.
