In his Politicsweb article of 11 November 2019 Hermann Giliomee one of South Africa’s preeminent historians revisits his longstanding leading role in opposing the officially sanctioned downgrading of Afrikaans which was recently sealed  as a ‘fait accompli’ by the unanimous Supreme Court decision effectively terminating Afrikaans as a language of instruction at the University of Stellenbosch. I happen to agree with his explication of the language aspects of the matter and, moreover, view the stark “Death Warrant of Afrikaans” title of his article as entirely apt. That said I am, however, at a loss to understand why Giliomee veers off his language concerns in his article to oddly introduce Piet Cillie who was the long-standing editor of ‘Die Burger’ newspaper during the second half of the 20th Century. During that period Giliomee rates it as having been the “most influential” of all South Africa’s newspapers one which was also rated by ‘The Times of London’ as among the “most outstanding newspapers in the world”. The latter accolade is somewhat surprising since the newspaper would hardly have been unaware of ‘Die Burger’s’ unstinting support of the government’s apartheid policies; the moreso in a country Cillie himself once described as the ‘polecat of the world’. But leaving this aside Giliomee’s fulsome praise for ‘Die Burger’ will mistakenly leave his readers with a misleadingly praiseworthy impression of Piet Cillie’s politics; perhaps especially so among younger Politicsweb readers interested in South African history. In point of fact, Cillie argued that as far as the black population was concerned their “political future had been successfully accommodated in the form of the governments’ policy of separate freedoms in the Bantus states”. In so far as the ‘coloured’ population was concerned their future lay in the governments’ policy of “parallel development” as opposed “to shared voting rights for whites and coloureds which would plunge the country into unprecedented political dislocation and racial struggle”. Nor did Cillie dissent from: racialized residential and educational segregation; large scale forced population removals from so-called white areas; job reservation for whites; bans on interracial sex and marriage or any of the gamut of other cradle to grave apartheid laws.
