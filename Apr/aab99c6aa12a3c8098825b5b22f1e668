Parliament on placing Carletonville crèche teacher on National Child Protection Register 5 April 2019 Social Development Committee says Carletonville Crèche teacher should be placed on National Child Protection Register once convicted The Portfolio Committee on Social Development says the illegal Carletonville crèche teacher that was filmed allegedly abusing and beating up children, once convicted should be placed on the National Child Protection Register so that she can never be allowed to work with children again. The National Child Protection Register contains a record of all the reports of abuse or deliberate neglect of a child, all convictions of all persons on charges involving the abuse or deliberate neglect of a child and all findings by a children's court that a child is in need of care and protection because of the abuse and deliberate neglect of the child. The committee wants to thank the law enforcement agencies for the speedy arrest of the perpetrators after the matter was brought to their attention. The committee calls on government to work with law enforcement agencies to monitor all facilities that take care of children to ensure that this kind of abuse does not happen at these facilities and that child protection is prioritised. The committee commends members of the public that highlighted the abuse on social media which led to the authorities acting swiftly in this matter. The committee calls on South Africans to report this type of behaviour immediately when it happens to avoid the trauma that is brought on by abuse. Issued by Parliament of South Africa, 5 April 2019
