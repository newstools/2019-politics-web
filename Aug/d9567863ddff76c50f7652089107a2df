Westville Girls High: DA calls for SAHRC probe following racism claims 9 August 2019 The Democratic Alliance in KwaZulu-Natal notes with concern the ongoing claims of racism at Westville Girls High. This follows yet another incident last week where it is alleged that an educator suggested that one race group is intellectually superior to another. The DA also notes that the educator has since been suspended with an investigation launched into the allegations. It is critical that all such allegations are properly investigated to ensure that claims made by any party are not mere slurs and that there is merit to the accusation. As such, the DA strongly believes that this latest incident needs to be investigated by a Chapter 9 Institution, in this case the South African Human Rights Commission. While South Africa has come a long way since apartheid it is worrying that even today remnants of this past injustice, which seek to divide us on the basis of race, still persist. Regrettably, this line of debate also exists within the KZN Legislature. Recently, the DA made suggestions to KZN’s Education MEC, Kwazi Mshengu around how to ensure improved budgeting and finances within his Department. The MECs response was that he will not take anything from the DA because - and this was his assertion - the DA is racist.  The MECs words imply that the DA only represents one racial group which is entirely untrue. Unfortunately this destructive mentality is what many ANC leaders in government constantly propagate from our experience.  This must stop. The DA will keep an eye on the progress of investigations at Westville Girls High and we appeal to the SAHRC to get involved. There can be no place in our country for anyone who thinks that one group of people is better than another, simply because of the colour of their skin.
