Another Fochville farm murder illustrates government do not have solutions to rural crime 29 July 2019 The DA is shocked by the brutal assault of a farmworker from Fochville who passed away as a result of the injuries he had sustained during a farm attack. It is alleged that he was attacked at his residence where he was tied up, beaten and forced to drink poison. His assailants made off with his car and personal belongings. He was rushed to hospital but passed away shortly after arrival. Westonaria SAPS has classified the crime as a house robbery. In the absence of separate and accurate rural crime statistics it is not possible to develop effective interventions. It is time for the Department of Agriculture to collaborate with the Department of Community Safety and to not see rural crime as a separate issue from agricultural production. In addition to the implementation of specialised and rural safety units, we call on Gauteng Premier, David Makhura to institute a special inter-ministerial task team to deal the situation in Gauteng. Gauteng is a rural crime hotspot and we urgently need a holistic and collaborative intervention that cuts across departments. In addition, we will be tabling our Community Safety Bill in the Gauteng Legislature. This dire situation cannot be allowed to continue where our people fall victim to violent and senseless crimes. We encourage all of Gauteng’s residents to sign our petition to stop the war on our rural communities. Issued by Ina Cilliers, DA Constituency Head: Merafong, 29 July 2019
