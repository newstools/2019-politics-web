Dros rapist deserves harshest possible sentence 9 September 2019 The Democratic Alliance Women’s Network (DAWN) has noted the fact that Nicholas Ninow has pleaded guilty to, among other things, raping a seven-year-old girl in the bathroom of a Dros restaurant in Pretoria last year. It is now in the hands of the Courts to deal with Ninow to the fullest extent of the law as he deserves the maximum possible punishment for raping a minor. Women and children are under siege by vile acts of sexual assault and Gender Based Violence. The scourge of violence against women and children is not new, it has been apart of our society for many years, and has been ignored by this callous government. For years the women of this country have been pleading with this government to protect women but our pleas have fallen on deaf ears. Instead we are told that government will look into, explore or examine possible solutions to address this scourge. We have had enough of these hollow promises. DAWN is of the view that there are four main actions that can be taken immediately to begin making a difference: - All police stations, across all provinces, need to have the required number of adult and pediatric rape kits in stock; - The National Sex Offenders Register needs to be updated; and, - Police officers who fail to assist victims that are reporting rape or abuse need to be dealt with far more harshly. DAWN wishes the victim and her family strength. We will continue to fight for the rights and safety of women in our country.
