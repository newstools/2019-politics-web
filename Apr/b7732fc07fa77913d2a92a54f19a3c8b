AfriForum convinced that Malema’s statements are hate speech: Submits application for review of SAHRC finding 17 April 2019 AfriForum today lodged an application for review at the South Gauteng High Court against the South African Human Rights Commission’s (SAHRC) finding that the statements made by Julius Malema, leader of the EFF, against white people are not hate speech. In 2016 Malema had the following to say about white people: “…They found peaceful Africans here. They killed them. They slaughtered them like animals. We are not calling for the slaughtering of white people, at least for now. What we are calling for is the peaceful occupation of the land and we don’t owe anyone an apology for that…” “AfriForum cannot leave the SAHRC’s finding that Malema’s statements are not hate speech undisputed. According to AfriForum, Malema’s statements comply with all the requirements for hate speech in terms of the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act, 2000 (Act No. 4 of 2000). It is worrying that the SAHRC has protected him with this finding and are, in essence, justifying such statements, but only if they are made in a certain context and by certain race groups,” says Natasha Venter, Campaign Officer at AfriForum. The SAHRC’s ruling is further in contrast to a working paper of the United Nations’ Forum on Minority Issues which determines that the rights of all minority groups, irrespective of their financial prosperity, should be protected. AfriForum cannot allow that individuals with political power, such as Malema, get away with racist utterances. Support AfriForum in this battle: SMS “Haatspraak” to 32782 (R1).
