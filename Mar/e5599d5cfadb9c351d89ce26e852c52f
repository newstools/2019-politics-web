ANC lists: Dodgy candidates belong in prison not Parliament 13 March 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) is not surprised by reports that the failing ANC has submitted provincial and national candidate lists to the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) which are filled with corrupt cadres, people who have actively undermined the Constitution, and alleged sex pests. These are individuals who belong in prison, not Parliament. They orchestrated the capture of our state, killed our economy and subjected our people to even further despair. If reports are to believed, it reaffirms the fact that Cyril Ramaphosa’s supposed New Dawn was nothing more than a farce as the ANC is incapable of change. The truth is that Ramaphosa is not leading the ANC, he is being led and instructed by the ANC of DD Mabuza and Ace Magashule. Reports indicate that known Zuma and Gupta loyalists including Bathabile Dlamini, Malusi Gigaba and Nomvula Mokonyane appear on the ANC’s national candidates lists. Other names apparently also included on these lists are individuals who have been embroiled in sexual scandals such as Pule Mabe and Zizi Kodwa. The ANC is a party devoid of ethics and is morally bankrupt. They have no intention of turning over a new leaf. In fact, it seems as though the ANC is more intent that ever to continue as a racketeering enterprise, which shamelessly and unabatedly steals from the poor. The ANC’s candidate lists will undoubtedly not only showcase their disregard for good governance and the rule of law, but also the party’s utter disdain for women’s rights. The DA on the other hand has the most diverse South Africans on its lists. People who are passionate about our country and about the party’s agenda to bring change which builds One South Africa for All. South Africans know the damage the ANC has caused over the past decade and they will surely punish them at the polls come Election Day. Issued by Solly Malatsi, DA National Spokesperson, 13 March 2019
