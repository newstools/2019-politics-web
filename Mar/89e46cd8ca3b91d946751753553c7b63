Services restored at Dr Yusuf Dadoo Hospital 7 March 2019 Following a four-day unprotected strike at Dr Yusuf Dadoo Hospital in Krugersdorp, the Gauteng Department of Health has obtained and served the court interdict to the striking employees. During the strike, outpatients were prevented from accessing the services, ambulance were prevented from entering the hospital, elective surgeries were postponed and critical patients were transferred to Leratong Hospital. “As a Department we were left with no option but to approach the courts to interdict the strikers and restore services to the facility. Although we respect the worker’s right to strike they should do so within the confines of the law, however, in the health facilities the primacy of the patients should reign supreme. “The employees at Dr Yusuf Dadoo embarked on unlawful or an unprotected strike which left patients unattended and risking their lives,” said Gauteng Head of Department Professor Mkhululi Lukhele. The court order declares the strike as unprotected and illegal in terms of section 68 of the Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995 as amended and it further ordered the responded to pay the cost of the application. The Department has given the striking employees an ultimatum to go back to their work station with immediate effect and failure to heed the call will result in summary dismissal. In the meantime, the hospital is effecting principle of no work no pay. “I would also like to express my appreciation to the doctors, nurses, allied, administration and general staff who continued to provide services and assisted our patients during this period. This is a clear indication that we still have dedicated employees who have the interest of the patients and the community at heart”, concluded professor Lukhele.
