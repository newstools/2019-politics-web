Ramaphosa exploited taxi drivers death for political gain 15 September 2019 President Cyril Ramaphosa's comments, during his visit to the City of Tshwane on Friday following the death of taxi driver Jabu Baloyi, who was allegedly killed by drug dealers, were wholly misleading . President Ramaphosa exploited Mr Baloyi's death for political gain. The fact is that the South African Police Service (SAPS) is controlled by the national ANC government. The DA-led City of Tshwane has no jurisdiction over the SAPS, only the metro police that enforces bylaws. The annual crime statistics released by the South African Police Service (SAPS) show how the police are failing to deal with increasing levels of crime such as murder, drugs and rape. Drug problems were, in fact, ignored by the previous ANC-led administration in Tshwane. The President was quoted by News24 as saying that the biggest mistake the people of Tshwane made, was not to vote for the ANC to take over the city. He was further quoted saying "the next time you vote, remember to vote for the ANC, vote right so we can attend to the scourge of drugs." Yes President Ramaphosa, voters in Tshwane should elect a better government nationally than the failing ANC. The DA-led City of Tshwane is doing all it can to help to combat anti-drug-related crimes. This includes setting up a specialised drug unit within the Tshwane Metro Police Department (TMPD). To date, this unit has made hundreds of arrests, patrolled the infamous Brown Street known for crime and drugs and its officers were send for FBI training to learn how to fight drug dealing. Furthermore, in August 2019, the DA-led City of Tshwane gave R20 million rand to Non Governmental Organisations (NGO's) to fight drug abuse. Only the DA can bring order to SA that builds One South Africa for All. Issued by John Moodey, DA Gauteng Provincial Leader, 15 September 2019
