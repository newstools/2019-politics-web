SACAA needs to ensure that Boeing 737 Max 8 aircrafts are safe 12 March 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) will be writing to the South Africa Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) and the Minister of Transport, Blade Nzimande with reference to all to aircraft models Boeing 737 MAX 8. This is after this type of aircraft crashed on Sunday in Ethiopia resulting in the deaths all 157 people on board. It is the second time in less than six months that a Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft has crashed within minutes of takeoff, after a new Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX 8 flight went down over the Java Sea last October, killing 189 people. Similarities between the two incidences should be a warning for the SACAA. Already airlines in the United States, China and Europe have grounded these aircraft and are undertaking investigations. It is for this reason the DA has written to SACAA and the Minister asking whether investigations are being undertaken on these aircrafts and if they are in communication with local airlines in this regard. In addition, the DA will be submitting Parliamentary questions to the Minister on this matter. The safety of passengers and air-crew should always be a priority.  The SACAA and the Minister needs to assure South Africans that this is the case and that they are doing everything in their power to protect South Africans and visitors alike from any potential dangers.
