Old faces in ‘new’ NW Cabinet do not inspire confidence in the fight against corruption 29 May 2019 The DA in North West notes the newly inaugurated Members of the Executive Council (MECs) announced by Premier Job Mokgoro yesterday, but the jury is still out on whether this cabinet will bring the necessary change towards a better future for all. During Premier Mokgoro’s inauguration speech on Monday, 27 May 2019, he solemnly pledged to uproot corruption, but with a cabinet containing seven recycled members and only three newcomers, it is unlikely that he will succeed. It is a well-known fact that Premier Mokgoro has been appointed as a peacekeeper between the factions within the ANC. With the bulk of his cabinet consisting of MECs from the Ramaphosa camp, the failing ANC is once again demonstrating their inability to reconcile the factions within the North West Province. Along with the announcement of his cabinet, Premier Mokgoro also stipulated the reconfiguration of Department of Finance, Economy and Enterprise Development (FEED), Rural, Environment and Agricultural Development (READ), Department of Education and Sports Development, Department of Culture, Arts and Traditional Affairs (CATA) and Department of Local Government and Human Settlements. The Premier has to communicate his plan of action with regards to the restructuring. We want to know what the cost, as well as practical implications of such a process will be. We will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Mokgoro’s cabinet and will see to it that they serve the interests of the people and not the pockets of the politically connected.
