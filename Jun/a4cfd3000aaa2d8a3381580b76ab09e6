Appointment of MEC for Education and Youth Development in Gauteng 1 June 2019 SADTU Gauteng notes the change in the deployment of MEC for Education from Comrade Nomantu Nkomo-Ralehoko to Comrade Panyaza Lesufi. We also note and welcome the incorporation of youth development into this portfolio as this will help to address high levels of unskilled and unemployment youth. We acknowledge the complexity of constituting an executive which includes listening to the voices of stakeholders and the citizens. We congratulate the Executive and all other comrades deployed to the legislature in various capacities. All hands on deck now. It is our considered view that we are making major strides in education transformation with the introduction of major interventions during the fifth administration. Such interventions require consolidation, improvement and expansion. We believe that Comrade Lesufi has full knowledge of the challenges and is thereby in a better position to address them unhindered. We welcome the appointment and look forward to continuing constructive engagements to accelerate the implementation of progressive policies of our movement, the African National Congress as well as the Freedom Charter;Â "The doors of learning and culture shall be opened".
