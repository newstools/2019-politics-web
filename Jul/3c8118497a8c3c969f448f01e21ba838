FF Plus demands answers after Douglasdale video 8 July 2019 The FF Plus in Gauteng sent an urgent letter to the MEC for Community Safety in Gauteng, Ms Faith Mazibuko, the Johannesburg Metro Police Chief, David Temba, the Johannesburg Mayor, Herman Mashaba, and the Mayoral Committee member for Community Safety, Michael Sun, after a video was circulated of a young woman being pinned down by a Metro Police officer in the Douglasdale police station while someone else takes a blood sample. In the letter, the FF Plus asks whether the correct procedure was followed in the Douglasdale police station or whether the relevant officer and his helper are guilty of an offence. In the video that spread like wildfire on social media, one can clearly see how an unknown woman is held down while blood is drawn from her arm. She is obviously in pain and crying out for help. Later the video also shows a young man standing outside the police station, busy taking a video of the events with his cell phone through the window. He is chased away and shoved numerous times. The FF Plus wants to determine the following: - What lead up to these events? - Did the woman take a breathalyser test? - Did the relevant police officers commit any offences and if so, what are the consequences for their misconduct? - Why is the woman being held down so blood can be drawn? What is the normal procedure in such a case? - What is the Johannesburg Metro Police and the South African Police Service's mandates in such cases? The FF Plus will later this week also bring the matter to the attention of the Community Safety Committee in the Gauteng Legislature. The FF Plus in Gauteng is also requesting the victims of the incident to contact the party on help@vfplus.org.za or 012 665-0564.
