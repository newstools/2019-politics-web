DA exposes more of Duarte’s abuse of the press 2 April 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) is appalled by the Deputy Secretary­-General of the African National Congress (ANC) Jessie Duarte’s verbal and personal attack on a media professional, Samkele Maseko. The DA is in possession of another video where Duarte verbally abuses a journalist at the ANC’s 2017 policy conference. It is both disgraceful and distasteful behaviour especially from someone who should at the frontline of protecting, upholding and advancing the rights of the people of South Africa, including journlists. This points to what has developed into an antagonistic attitude towards the media by the ANC. In a similar fashion, back in 2016 Duarte launched a vitriolic attack on reporter Luyolo Mkentane. Mkentane described the attack as “bullying”. The growing hostility towards the Fourth Estate by both ANC and EFF should be condemned by all South Africa who believe in the role of the media to inter alia expose corruption, disseminate information and hold public figures accountable. The DA views Duarte’s recurring behaviour as careless and irresponsible from a leader and treats it with the contempt it deserves. If the ANC of Cyril Ramaphosa respects the sanctity of press freedom, he will take strong and public action against Duarte The DA will continue to fight for the protection of the free media and independent reporting, and we will oppose any one who attacks the freedom of the press.
