Defense classes, more policing, education needed for society's most vulnerable 5 November 2019  Nicole Mirkin was a key organiser in the #EnoughisEnough parliamentary march against gender based violence in September. Nicole has spent the past year creating Fight Back SA that organises self defense classes for vulnerable for women and girls in underprivileged areas in the Western Cape. In this podcast she argues that better policing and an adjustment to the Life Orientation curriculum are effective weapons in the campaign against gender based violence. She also addresses the role the men are playing in helping to fight this scourge. Benji Shulman is a broadcaster on 101.9 ChaiFM, find him on twitter at @benji_shulman
