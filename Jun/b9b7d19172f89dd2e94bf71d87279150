Minister of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries, Ms Barbara Creecy notes the application lodged by NGOs on air quality challenges in Mpumalanga highveld area 10 June 2019 Newly-appointed Minister for Environment, Forestry and Fisheries, Ms Barbara Creecy notes the application lodged by Groundwork and Vukani Environment represented by the Centre for Environmental Rights, and agrees there are air quality challenges in the Mpumalanga Highveld Area. The Minister notes that there was extensive engagement on this matter during the Fifth Administration which resulted in the current review of  the Air Quality Management Plan for the area. Air Quality Management Plan is a tool used in managing the quality of air, as it spells out specific activities/ interventions to be undertaken by individual polluters and includes commitments by industry. The aim of the review is to find sustainable and practical ways to improve the quality of air, in line with our Constitutional obligations. Accordingly, it would be her preference that there is further engagement outside of a court process to find ways to satisfy the needs of citizens living in these areas for better quality air.
