31% unemployment rate in Gauteng shows government is failing to create job opportunities 30 October 2019 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_2',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng is shocked by the announcement that the unemployment rate is the highest it has been in 11 years. This announcement was made by the Statistician-General, Risenga Maluleke during the release of the Quarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS) for the third quarter of 2019. The national unemployment rate is at 29.1%, while the Gauteng’s unemployment rate is currently at 31% for the third quarter of 2019. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));This is a clear indication that the province is moving backwards instead of forward. The Gauteng Provincial Government has failed to create employment opportunities for our people, particularly the youth. Premier David Makhura is constantly talking about creating work opportunities for people in Gauteng, but the QLFS results clearly indicate that this strategy is not working. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));For the 2018/2019 financial year, the Premier’s office failed to meet its target set for ensuring that economically excluded youth are assisted in finding job opportunities. In addition, the Gauteng Enterprise Propeller (GEP) also failed to assist 75 youth through the Youth Accelerator Programme during the first financial quarter of 2019. Programmes like the one run by the Premier’s office and GEP are important as they play a pivotal role in ensuring that the unemployed, especially the youth are given the skills and training needed to find work opportunities if managed properly. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0']));Its high time that Premier Makhura and his cabinet should go back to the drawing board and rework their strategy to create a province with the right economic environment for the creation of job opportunities.
