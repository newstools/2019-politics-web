The DA sends its heartfelt condolences to the families, friends, staff, and loved ones who are affected by this tragedy. It is very concerning that there continues to be a lack of political will in the Northern Cape to tackle the growing scourge of school violence. Year after year, learners are dying in senseless violent altercations at school but no viable plan has been offered by the provincial government to deal with the problem Just recently, a 17 year old learner, Itumeleng “Sarah” Witbooi, died from injuries sustained in an altercation with three fellow learners.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0'])); This senseless loss of lives cannot not be allowed to continue. School safety and violence in schools is a societal problem requiring all stakeholders to play their part in creating a safe schooling environment for our learners. Schools are supposed to be safe spaces and sites of learning. Parents should be able to send their children to school with the assurance that their safety is guaranteed and they will not be exposed to violence or harm.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0'])); However, as is currently the case, schools have been turned into centres of violence, trauma and loss of lives. A joint school safety response is critical for the enforcement of school safety protocols and the mobilisation of communities to prevent violence and deaths of learners at schools.
