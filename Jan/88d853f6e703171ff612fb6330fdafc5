Hlaudi made first payment of cost award to Solidarity 28 January 2019 Former SABC chief operating officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng, made a first payment of R300 000 to Solidarity. This comes after Solidarity had embarked on a process to seize his goods. According to Solidarity Chief Executive Dr Dirk Hermann, the Labour Court in 2017 ruled that Motsoeneng was personally liable for the legal costs incurred in the lawsuit in which it was found that the so-called SABC 7 had been dismissed unlawfully. According to Dr Hermann, this payment is only a part payment of what Motsoeneng owes. “The final amount owing will be determined once the costs associated with the Constitutional Court ruling which Motsoeneng also lost, have been paid and included in the final amount due,” Hermann said. “Ironically, the Labour Court case is therefore being paid for by Motsoeneng and no one else. Solidarity has decided to use the money received from Motsoeneng in litigation against tax abuse. Although we will deposit Hlaudi’s money in a fund to counter further tax abuse, we will not name the fund after him,” Hermann said. Solidarity will go ahead with legal processes to recover the rest of the monies owing to it. Issued by Francois Redelinghuys, Spokesperson, Solidarity, 28 January 2019
