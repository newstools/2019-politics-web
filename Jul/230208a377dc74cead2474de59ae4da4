Public Protector notes Minister Gordhan’s court challenge of her report and is disappointed at the indignity of personal insults contained in the court application 10 July 2019 Public Protector Adv. Busisiwe Mkhwebane notes the urgent application by the Minister of Public Enterprises Mr Pravin Gordhan, MP to suspend and interdict the implementation of the remedial action contained in her recent report involving Mr. Gordhan. The report followed an investigation into an alleged violation of the Executive Ethics Code by Mr. Gordhan as well as allegations of maladministration, corruption and improper conduct by the South African Revenue Service. Adv. Mkhwebane also noted the application to have the report reviewed. She accepts that a review is part of the prescribed process available to aggrieved parties to challenge reports emanating from her office. However, Adv. Mkhwebane wishes to record her disappointment at how the court application is cloaked in the indignity of personal insults. She will only be commenting on the facts of the matter as engaging in the personal insults is below the dignity of the high offices of responsibility which she and the Minister occupy. Although the matter is reported to be brought on an urgent basis, as at noon today, the Public Protector is still not formally served with court papers. She will, however, be defending the matter as she has full confidence in the veracity of her findings. “It is our considered opinion that the emotive language and personal insults and blatant lies or innuendos are meant to divert attention from the real issues and the findings,” she said.
