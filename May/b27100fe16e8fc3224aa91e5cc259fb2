SA Express to lay fraud and corruption charges against former executives 23 May 2019 As South African Express (SAX) continues to strengthen both its operational efficiency and governance systems to achieve long-term commercial sustainability, the airline is preparing to lay fraud and corruption charges against some of its former executives. SAX chairperson, Tryphosa Ramano, said today that the decision to charge the former executives came after a thorough forensic investigation flagged a number of transactions which may have prejudiced the airline of millions of rands prior to SAX’s temporary grounding in May 2018. “The new Board of Directors of SA Express takes all allegations of impropriety by staff and other stakeholders of the airline very, very seriously. “This is why the airline is taking this strong action because all allegations involving fraud, corruption and other irregularities demand a robust and prompt response, as well as the severest of sanctions against fingered parties,” Ramano said. The transactions which were flagged by the forensic investigation include multi-million rand cases of alleged collusion with service providers, manipulation of procurement processes, as well as the irregular and overpayment of suppliers. SAX will not be commenting further on this issue, pending the action and legal processes that are underway. Meanwhile, Ramano says the airline continues to drive its improved performance and strategic plans on the strength of five strategic pillars, with clear initiatives and outcomes. “The five key pillars are anchored around good corporate governance, working to grow our revenue and to achieve profitability, engendering operational efficiency, improving our product offerings and services, and retaining and developing competent staff,” she said.
