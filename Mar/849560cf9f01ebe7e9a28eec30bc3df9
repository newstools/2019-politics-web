FF Plus’s top national candidates and provincial premier candidates 2019-03-05 Dr Pieter Groenewald The FF Plus has announced its list of top national candidates and its list of nine premier candidates. Both lists are characterised by competence and expertise and offer a good mix of young blood and seasoned experience in politics. Of the party's top 20 national candidates 25% are female candidates who were all selected based on merit. Among the first 10 candidates, 20% are female. Among the first 20 candidates, there are four people with doctorates (Drs Pieter Groenewald, Corné Mulder, Lourie Bosman and Wynand Boshoff) as well as various lawyers including three attorneys, namely Jennifer Rautenbach, Heloïse Jordaan and Marlene Steyn-du Toit, and an advocate, namely Anton Alberts. Each person on the list was selected because they deserve to be there, not only because they have made a positive contribution to the FF Plus, but also because they will be able to contribute significantly should they be elected to act on behalf of the country. The nine provincial premier candidates are all seasoned politicians with a lot of experience. The FF Plus is proud to introduce them to the public and is convinced that they have the required skills to serve South Africa's voters in the best possible way.
