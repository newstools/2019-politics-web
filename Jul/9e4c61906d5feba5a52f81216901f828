DA will oppose transfer of Gauteng Academic Hospitals to national government 2 July 2019 Gauteng Premier David Makhura made some welcome promises to fix Gauteng hospitals in his State of the Province speech yesterday, but I am concerned by his view that the four academic hospitals should be the responsibility of national government. These four hospitals (Chris Hani Baragwanath, Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg, Steve Biko and George Mukhari) are an essential part of our provincial health system. Their combined budget this year is R14.2 billion, which is 28% of the total R50.8 billion health budget. Makhura is admitting failure to run these hospitals properly, but his proposal for the national health department to take them over would be a disaster. It would dangerously fragment the health system in Gauteng and jeopardize academic training for student doctors. Accountability would also suffer if they were taken away from provincial control and oversight. The DA administration in the Western Cape runs its three academic hospitals well, and will oppose the NHI proposal that they be transferred to national government. Makhura is ducking his responsibility to run a comprehensive health system with all levels of care, from primary to specialist. He should rather ensure that proper support is given to our four academic hospitals so that they can provide quality care to patients. Issued byÂ Jack Bloom, DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC, 2 July 2019
