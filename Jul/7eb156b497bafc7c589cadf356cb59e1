DA concerned about human trafficking in Gauteng 31 July 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng is dismayed to learn that a baby had almost become another victim of alleged human trafficking. According to media reports the 3-month-old baby was fortunately rescued by his father before he could be sold by his uncle. The mother was allegedly raped and killed by the uncle. The baby was found 40 days after he was abducted from his home in Zola North, Soweto. This latest incident of human trafficking is concerning and more needs to be done about the scourge of modern day slavery in Gauteng. Last year, 46 women were rescued from human traffickers in the Johannesburg CBD after police busted a human trafficking ring. Earlier this year five Pretoria police officers were arrested for their alleged involvement in human trafficking. Corruption in the South African Police Service (SAPS) is rife and cannot be tolerated. The DA seeks to rid the SAPS of corrupt and unprofessional officers. The DA will continue to call for the establishment of specialised units within SAPS to combat the issue of human trafficking and gender-based violence, as South Africa has become the clearing house for international human trafficking syndicates. Police are ill-equipped, untrained and under-resourced to adequately address this heinous crime against humanity. It is totally unacceptable. I will be tabling questions in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature to determine what measures are in place to prevent human trafficking in the province.
