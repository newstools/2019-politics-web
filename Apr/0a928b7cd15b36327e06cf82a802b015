Ace's legal threats: The DA will see him in court 5 April 2019 During an interview with eNCA yesterday, former Free State Premier Magashule indicated that he is in the process of instituting legal action against Pieter Louis Myburgh, among others, as a result of various allegations made against him in the book “Gangster State”. During the interview Magashule stated that: “I have never done anything that is unlawful, illegal, wrong or unethical”. After serving as both leader of the DA and Leader of the Opposition in the Free State Legislature during his term of office as Premier, I look forward to being called as a witness during these court proceedings so that I can outline his failure to investigate and his complicity in the many allegations of unlawful, illegal, wrong and unethical activities of the provincial government that he was head of as Premier that were brought to his attention in the Legislature. The Hansard of the Legislature and other documents will expose how he misled the Legislature and used insults and personal attacks on members of the opposition who exposed these activities to divert attention away from all the malfeasance that was laid before him. Magashule must not confuse the unwillingness to investigate allegations of corruption due to the capture of law enforcement agencies in the Free State by an ANC faction, with a presumption of innocence. Regarding legal action, Magashule said the country must “watch this space”. We look forward to filling that space for him during the court proceedings that he claims to be instituting. Magashule has much to answer for and the DA would like to see him I court, not a civil court but a criminal court.
