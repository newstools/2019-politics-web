Gumede’s extended leave proof that the ANC is not serious about corruption 6 August 2019 The Democratic Alliance in eThekwini notes the ANC’s further indecision on embattled Mayor Zandile Gumede. The outcome of the PEC extends the leave of Gumede and her co-accused, Mondli Mthembu, which will need to come to Council for approval, and will certainly not be supported by the DA. This decision further shows that the ANC is not serious about rooting out corruption in eThekwini. The city is in a shambles with service delivery at an all-time low. The ANC-led administration was only able to spend 72% of the municipality’s capital budget, with rising debt and revenue losses. The ANC’s press conference on this matter illustrates what we have known all along - that the ANC in eThekwini is obsessed with personalities, factions and power, and care little for the mess that they have left eThekwini in. There is enough evidence that Gumede is corrupt, that she has been a terrible Mayor, and that she is closely linked to all of the city’s problems. Why won’t the ANC get their act together and fire her? The DA is proceeding with our motion to remove Zandile Gumede from the eThekwini Executive Committee, and subsequently as Mayor. We have consulted our legal teams and will ensure that this motion sees the light of day. The ANC has failed and continue to fail the people of eThekwini. The DA is actively working towards building a new majority in eThekwini in 2021 by getting rid of the corrupt and uncaring ANC. Issued by Nicole Graham, DA eThekwini Caucus Leader, 6 August 2019
