Mashaba is running away 21 October 2019 The ANC Greater Johannesburg Region is not shocked by the resignation of Herman Mashaba as Mayor of our once great City. Mashaba's resignation has very little to do with the election of Helen Zille as the DA's Chairperson. His resignation is informed by the dire financial crisis that he has plunged the City of Johannesburg into. He has over time been able to get away With lies about the financial affairs of the City. Mashaba's is running away from the soon to be exposed truth that the City of Johannesburg is broke and may not be able to finance the day to day basic costs of providing water and electricity to Johannesburg residents including paying salaries to staff. Mashaba has always said he is there through the will of the people but he resigns due to party political matters that have nothing to do with the city. Mashaba is a sore loser; he is not a democrat. Just because he lost a battle in the party; he throws his toys out of the cot. Mashaba is an attention seeker who was going down anyway. He needed an "honourable" exit and Zille's election is a perfect excuse. Issued by Jolidee Matongo, Regional Spokesperson, ANC Gauteng, 21 October 2019
