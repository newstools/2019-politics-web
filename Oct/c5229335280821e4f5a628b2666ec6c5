DA Interim Parliamentary Leadership 24 October 2019 The Democratic Alliance’s (DA) Parliamentary Caucus sat today to discuss the resignation of Mmusi Maimane from the Party and as a Member of Parliament.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0'])); As Caucus Chairperson, I will now act as the Interim Parliamentary Leader until a Caucus election takes place. I would also like to dispel the false reports that John Steenhuisen has resigned as Chief Whip of the DA’s Parliamentary Caucus. The tenure of the Chief Whip of the National Assembly is linked to that of the Parliamentary Leader. This is because the Parliamentary Leader appoints the Chief Whip. In light of Mr. Maimane’s resignation as MP this morning, Mr. Steenhuisen’s tenure automatically came to an end. The DA’s Deputy Chief Whip, Jacques Julius, who was elected by Caucus, will take over as Interim Chief Whip.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0'])); These positions will remain until such time an Interim Federal Leader is elected at the next Federal Council. In the event that the newly elected Interim Federal Leader is a Member of Parliament, said person will automatically be the Leader of the Parliamentary Caucus in terms of Section 9.3 of the Party’s Constitution. Should the Interim Parliamentary Leader not be a Member of Parliament, Caucus will elect a Parliamentary Leader, who will in turn appoint a Chief Whip. The DA’s Parliamentary Caucus would like to wish Mr. Maimane well in his next chapter and thank him for his leadership and commitment to the Democratic Project.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2',114,'0','0'])); Issued by Annelie Lotriet, DA Interim Parliamentary Leader, 24 October 2019
