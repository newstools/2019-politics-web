EFF statement on EFF MP and Commissar Tebogo Mokwele receiving money from Cyril Ramaphosa 18 August 2019 The EFF has confirmed that our Commissar and MP Tebogo Mokwele received a total of R40 000 from Cyril Ramaphosa through his CR17 account. She has since confessed to the EFF leadership and indicated that the money related to a personal problem (bereavement) she had, which President Ramaphosa was assisting with. We call on all other Commissars and Fighters to come out clean and confess if they have received any money from Ramaphosa and his CRI 7 accounts. Commissar Mokwele's confirmation that she received the money after speaking to President Ramaphosa is a confirmation that Ramaphosa was directly involved in the accounts that were paying money to different recipients in the CR17 campaign. The leadership of the EFF will be in discussion as to what cause of action to take on Commissar Tebogo Mokwele. Issued by Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, National Spokesperson, EFF, 18 August 2019
