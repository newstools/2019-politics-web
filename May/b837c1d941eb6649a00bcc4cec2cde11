Makhura’s delay in cabinet announcement impacting negatively on service delivery 28 May 2019 Gauteng Premier David Makhura’s delay in announcing his cabinet is impacting negatively on service delivery in this province. Premier Makhura was set to make the announcement today, however, the Democratic Alliance (DA) has learnt that infighting amongst the ANC members has resulted in these delays. This clearly indicates that the ANC is a party in disarray. The ANC’s Gauteng Provincial Legislature members are fighting over MEC positions which shows that they only care about enriching themselves and not the needs of Gauteng’s residents. The Premier’s decisions must not only be based on struggle credentials but also competence and the ability to lead and deliver better services to our people. The longer Makhura delays his appointment, the more our people will suffer as there will be no provincial government services being rendered. Gauteng’s government departments cannot function properly without a political head to provide much needed direction. Gauteng residents have suffered enough under an ANC-led administration and we can longer tolerate such underperformance. The DA calls on Premier Makhura to appoint his cabinet as a matter of urgency so that provincial departments can begin to provide services to the people of this province.
