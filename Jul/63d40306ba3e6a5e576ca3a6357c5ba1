Eskom restores supply to co-operating areas 22 July 2019 Eskom has restored supply to some parts of Gauteng where communities have allowed its technicians safe access to conduct audits, remove illegal connections, disconnect non-paying customers and issue fines. Eskom, ward councillors and community leaders have collaborated in working with the affected communities to resume with the operations without incidents, and we are pleased to announce that power was restored in some parts of Ivory Park, Diepsloot ext 10 and Braamfischer, subsequent to successful audit processes being carried out. “We are of the view that we can build more successes in other areas emulating from these pockets of excellence. Furthermore, customers are now metered, they buy tokens from Eskom’s authorised outlets, and we have seen some improvements in the buying patterns and the tamper fine payments are also on an increase and this is encouraging” said Motlhabane Ramashi, Senior Manager for Operations and Maintenance in the Gauteng Operating Unit. Eskom will continue to constantly monitor the infrastructure and electricity payment trends in an effort to promote a culture of paying for electricity services. On the other hand, we will continue to restore supply in areas where the community grants us access to perform our duties to alleviate the network overloading and ensure quality supply of electricity to paying customers. In conclusion, we are engaging with communities in areas with overloading network as a result of illegal connections and bypassed meters. This is a proactive measure to conduct audits in order to avoid more equipment failure. Issued by Eskom Media Desk, 22 July 2019
