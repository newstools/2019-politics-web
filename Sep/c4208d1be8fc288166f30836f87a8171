Warrants of arrest issued for two alleged murderers of Rwandan Head of Intelligence 9 September 2019 The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) informed Adv. Gerrie Nel, Head of AfriForum’s Private Prosecution Unit, that the NPA has issued warrants of arrest for two of the four alleged murderers of Col. Patrick Karegeya, the former Rwandan Head of Intelligence. The NPA is also in the process of applying for the extradition of Ismael Gafaranga and Alex Sugira. As soon as the extradition request is granted, the NPA will apply to Interpol for the issuing of so-called “Red Notices” for the suspects. This follows Adv. Nel and the Private Prosecution Unit supporting the Karegeya family in the informal inquest into the death of Karegeya. The Randburg Magistrate’s Court in April of this year referred the case back to the NPA for them to decide whether they will prosecute the responsible suspects, as found in the court’s order. According to Adv. Nel the NPA’s notice is a big victory. “However, it is also an indication that the NPA has abused the legal system as warrants for arrest were issued without any further investigation. This after the NPA indicated that they could not make a decision to prosecute on the available evidence and recommended a judicial inquest.” AfriForum revealed this abuse of the legal system during the judicial inquest proceedings, and the court, on Adv. Nel’s advice, refused to continue with the inquest. “The only feasible conclusion is that the NPA wanted to avoid a prosecution. We welcome the current steps and hope that the NPA will continue with the process keenly. AfriForum’s Private Prosecution Unit and the family of the deceased will closely monitor the process.” Issued by Carina Bester, Media Relations Officer, AfriForum, 9 September 2019
