New DA Parliamentary leadership team ready to fight for all South Africans 31 October 2019 Following today’s DA Parliamentary Caucus meeting, I am pleased to announce that I have appointed Natasha Mazzone MP as the DA’s Chief Whip in the National Assembly. Having served with distinction as a Member of Parliament for the past decade, Natasha brings an ideal balance of knowledge, grit and levelheadedness to this crucial position. During her time as the DA’s Shadow Minister of Public Enterprises, Natasha worked tirelessly to strengthen our democracy by leading the charge against the pervasive corruption and maladministration in our State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs). I look forward to working alongside Natasha as we strive to build a stronger opposition that will vigorously hold the executive accountable, while offering real policy and legislative alternatives to get South Africa working again. In addition to Natasha’s appointment, Jacques Julius MP will remain in his position as Deputy Chief Whip following his election in May of this year. Finally, I have appointed Solly Malatsi MP as Parliamentary Counsellor to the DA Parliamentary Leader. I am confident that this talented and diverse team has what it takes to spearhead our fight for the interests of all South Africans, and in particular those left behind by the failing ANC government. As the Official Opposition in Parliament, we are ready to roll up our sleeves and hit the ground running as we strive to build a prosperous South Africa that works for all. The DA will fight for an enterprise economy that provides real opportunities, a world class basic education system and a modern, non-racial society governed by the rule of law.
