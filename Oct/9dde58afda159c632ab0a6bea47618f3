The Interim Leadership will hold their positions until Federal Congress is convened – which is provisionally set for April 2020. The DA is a resilient party of rules, structures and procedures and looks forward to electing an Interim Leader through constitutionally sound processes.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0'])); The past two weeks have been a difficult period for the Party, and we thank our members, supporters and staff for their continued commitment during this time.
