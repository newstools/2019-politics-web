Stilfontein High School: FF Plus lays criminal charge against ANC, EFF 16 January 2019 The FF Plus has laid a criminal charge against the ANC and the EFF because the two parties violated the Schools Act this past week during protest actions at Stilfontein High School in the North West province. Section 33A of the Schools Act determines that no political activities may take place on school grounds during school hours. On Monday and Tuesday, rioters disrupted school activities by, among other things, damaging school property and protesting on the school grounds. There were numerous protesters wearing ANC and EFF clothing and that is why it is deemed a political gathering during school hours. The ANC and EFF are acting irresponsibly by exploiting incidents like the one at Stilfontein High School in an effort to score cheap political points. The parties are thus also violating the IEC's ethical code of conduct. Parties must afford the Department of Education the opportunity to complete its investigation before making irresponsible and inflammatory statements which hamper teaching and learning and jeopardise the safety of learners and teachers.
