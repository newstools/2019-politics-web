I want to shoot straight with you 18 November 2019 My fellow Democrats,eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_6',112,'0','0'])); I wanted to write to you directly after my election yesterday as interim leader of the DA, to brief you on my vision for moving the party forward. We have an opportunity to rebuild the DA, and I plan to use it. As we set off on this path, I want you to know exactly what you can expect from me.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_5',113,'0','0'])); The DA will be a party grounded in values, and not one led by whatever happens to be the populist cause of the day. Just because we’re at the centre of our political landscape, doesn’t mean we must try to be everything to everyone. Of all the major parties, we’re the only one fighting for a truly non-racial South Africa, where real equality of opportunity will mean we won’t have to try and engineer equality of outcome. It is spurious to argue that only race-based policies can lift people out of poverty. That is a false choice.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_7',114,'0','0'])); We will be a party marked by generosity, empathy, and deep commitment to fighting poverty. Because you cannot live a life you value if you are hungry, poorly educated, live in unhealthy conditions, and fear for your safety. The DA I lead will not waver in this. We will pursue this goal of fighting poverty wherever we are.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_8',115,'0','0'])); I have asked every DA member and supporter to commit to this vision too. If we all agree on what we’re fighting for, then whatever other differences we might have become irrelevant. If like me, you know that to survive, South Africa needs a strong DA, then please stand with me. Please consider donating R21 to campaign 2021. With only 59 weeks to go until this campaign kicks off, the journey to South Africa’s recovery starts now, with you and I. Together, we will build a party whose actions speak far louder than its words. Kind regards, John Steenhuisen DA Interim Leader
