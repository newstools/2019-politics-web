FF Plus in Gauteng will compel government to implement rural safety plan 23 May 2019 The FF Plus cannot just stand idly by and look on as farmers and their children are attacked and murdered in Gauteng and the rest of the country. The FF Plus in Gauteng plans to have discussions with the Gauteng Premier, David Makhura, and senior members of the Police service regarding the implementation of a comprehensive rural safety plan very soon. Mr Kobus Hoffman, one the FF Plus's new members of the provincial Legislature, will serve on the Community Safety Portfolio Committee where he will introduce the plan. He will also engage with the members of organised agricultural and civil organisations to get their input and draw on their expertise. In the most recent incident, a farmer and his daughter were attacked earlier this week on their farm near Fochville. The 55-year-old man was preparing to take his 17-year-old daughter to school when robbers assailed them outside their home. They were both forced to go back into the house where the farmer was hit in the head and his daughter was raped. The robbers apparently got away in the farmer's silver-grey Ford Ranger. The FF Plus's councillor in the Merafong Local Municipality, Mr Ben van der Berg, visited the farm, but when he arrived there it was deserted. He will convey a message from the party to the victims at a later stage. The FF Plus will keep fighting for the safety of every South African and will help build a country where everyone can live and work without fear.
