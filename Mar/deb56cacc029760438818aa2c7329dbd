Failing ANC Gauteng’s budget is killing jobs 5 March 2019 Although Gauteng is a province with great potential, the ANC have instead chosen to use this year’s budget to campaign for the election in May. The budget presented by MEC Crecy kills jobs in the province by decreasing the infrastructure spend in real terms. Investment in infrastructure is ultimately necessary to create an environment where businesses can grow and create jobs. The residents of this province do not want increased grants, they want real jobs so they can provide for their families. Yet the ANC in Gauteng is trying to win back lost support by increasing social grants and salaries and supporting a bloated public sector. It is also ironic that the ANC in Gauteng has increased the budget for township economies, yet it is the worst performer nationally when it comes to paying suppliers on time. Currently businesses in the townships are struggling to survive due to non-payment by government departments. This is yet another gimmick by the failing ANC. Only under a DA-led government will the township economy thrive. The budget also aims to plug the bleeding holes in an already crippled Health Department, rather than taking a long-term view by investing in the infrastructure needed to stimulate the economy. Only R33.7 billion has been budgeted for infrastructure over the next three years. Worryingly, the school infrastructure budget is a mere R1.952 billion which is certainly not sufficient to deal with our aging and deteriorating school buildings. This province will end up paying dearly for a budget that lacks vision and strategic direction. A DA government would focus on creating jobs in the province by investing in infrastructure and ensure an environment where businesses can grow and create jobs. The people of Gauteng will have an opportunity to build a province that works by voting for the DA. Issued by Solly Msimanga, DA Gauteng Premier Candidate, 5 March 2019
