DA in North West demands answers after senseless death of baby at Mahikeng Provincial Hospital 2 September 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) in North West is outraged by the reported death of a baby at the Mahikeng Provincial Hospital last week. It is alleged that the infant sustained burn wounds caused by an incubator, after which he was transferred to Pretoria, and died on the way to the hospital. We extend our heartfelt condolences to the family of the infant; no parent should ever have to endure the pain of losing a child. While the DA notes the Department of Health MEC, Madoda Sambatha’s commitment to investigate the horrific incident, we demand that a criminal investigation be carried out. It is simply unacceptable for any patient to die due to injuries caused by the very health care facility charged with delivering medical treatment and we will leave no stone unturned in ensuring that justice prevails. This sorrowful incident again places the spotlight on the poor quality of care provided in provincial medical facilities. Dilapidated buildings, unequalled shortages of equipment, numerous vacancies of critical staff and collapsed Emergency Medical Services will inevitably lead to more deaths if urgent action is not taken. Under a DA-led government the people of this province will receive the healthcare services they are entitled to.
