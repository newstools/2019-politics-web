Senseless farm attack in Fochville emphasizes need for Rural Safety Units 20 May 2019 The DA is saddened by the senseless farm attack on a father and daughter on a plot just outside Fochville this morning. The pair were preparing to leave for school when they were attacked on their property. The Father’s bakkie was stolen but later recovered in Bekkersdal. It is alarming that when reporting the incident to SAPS, the SAPS member opening the case refused to categorize this crime as a farm attack, insisting rather that this should be classified as common assault. The DA has, over a number of years, insisted that rural safety units should be established to deal with the unprecedented number of attacks on people living on farms, rural areas and small holdings. It is for this reason that the DA will table the Community Safety Bill which will see the functions of the MEC for safety strengthened. The Bill will provide for new ways of monitoring, oversight and assessment of policing at provincial level, and to this end, a Provincial Police Ombudsman. During this new term of office, the DA will ensure that through this Bill, these units become a reality and that those who live outside of urban centres are afforded the safety and security they deserve.
