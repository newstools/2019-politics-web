DA Joburg Caucus on the Failed Motion against Speaker of Council, Clr Vasco Da Gama The Democratic Alliance (DA) Johannesburg Caucus condemns the ANC and its voting partners’ attempts to subvert the democratic outcomes which saw the Motion of No Confidence (MONC) against Speaker of Council, Clr Vasco Da Gama fail to pass. On Thursday, 05 December 2019, South Africa witnessed first-hand, the ANCs flagrant disregard for democratic processes. Ironically, these were the very same processes and rules which had led to the election of their Mayoral candidate the day before.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0'])); Though the result of Mayoral election was a difficult moment as the ANC and its candidate Clr Makhubo assumed the role of Executive Mayor, the DA Caucus as indicated in our statement, graciously conceded defeat and congratulated the ANC. We did this out of our respect for democracy and the Constitution. Yet, when the motion against Speaker of Council, Clr Da Gama failed, the ANC resorted to aggressive and violent attempts at refusing the Speaker the opportunity to resume his role, and denied the Council the opportunity to continue with its business. It is disappointing that a day after the ANC was entrusted with the Mayoral responsibility, it has already demonstrated its inability to adhere to Council Rules and established democratic processes. This sets a worrying tone for how the ANC and its partners will conduct themselves in Executive positions for the remainder of this term.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0'])); At the same time however, the failed motion against Speaker Da Gama is an indication of the DA and its remaining coalition partner’s resolve to continue to fight for the residents of Johannesburg. This result effectively presents an opportunity for a Multiparty Legislature to exist and to hold the ANC-led executive to account. It demonstrates that the DA will not allow the City to crumble under the weight of corrupt and unscrupulous tendencies. We shall not be deterred in our efforts to create a free, prosperous and equal society underpinned by the principles of Freedom, Fairness, Opportunity and Diversity. We march on towards realising the vision of One South Africa For All.
