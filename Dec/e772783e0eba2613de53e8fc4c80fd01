Coalition of corruption unlawfully takes over Tshwane The Democratic Alliance (DA) will challenge the Tshwane Special Council decisions in court, as the processes to remove Speaker Katlego Mathebe and Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa were unlawful. The DA is horrified by the scene that unfolded in Council, which resembled nothing short of a coup. African National Congress (ANC) and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) councillors were joined in an illegal grab of power which descended the meeting into absolute chaos. When the meeting started, Speaker Mathebe recused herself to make way for her elected deputy, Cllr Zweli Khumalo. This was necessary as the first item on the agenda was a Motion Of No Confidence (MONC) against herself. The EFF physically blocked Cllr Khumalo from taking the Speakers seat which led to a series of adjournments. In a concerted pre-arranged move, the ANC illegally brought in Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (COGTA) Deputy Director General, Willy Bhila, to preside over the meeting. When the DA objected to the presence of Bhila as it was illegal, the ANC and EFF Councillors continued by electing EFF Councillor Obakeng Ramabudo to preside over a motion that led to the removal of Speaker Mathebe. Moments later, the ANC and EFF proceeded with a motion to remove Mayor Stevens Mokgalapa. Observers must have thought they were no longer in South Africa but in a banana republic. To quote F D Roosevelt, “today is a day that will live in infamy.” What has occurred is an outrage and an attack on our hard fought for democracy. The DA will not allow this coalition of corruption to reverse the three years of good work done by the DA-led administration in the City of Tshwane.
