ANC accuses EFF of vote buying through free driver's, learner's licence ad 13 March 2019 The ANC has accused the EFF of vote buying and offering monetary inducements in exchange for electoral support. The party said that it "has noted with alarm the desperate antics of the EFF in the form of a digital banner offering free drivers' licences making rounds on social media. The digital banner reads: "Free drivers and learners licenses 10-31 March 2018. "Public High Schools, TVET Colleges, Universities & Unemployed Ladies between the ages of 18 & 25. "Sign up for sending your details i.e, age, institution, school and proof of registration to vote in 2019 general elections". EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi dismissed the allegations as fake. "The ANC knows as we all do that it is lying. Firstly, the poster they refer to comes from 2018. Secondly, none of the official EFF accounts has tweeted it. Thirdly, even in 2018, the Students Command did indicate that such information is incorrect. "Also, they are the ones well-known, even as demonstrated by the Public Protector, who use food parcels to buy votes. We will defeat them through the power of our ideas," said Ndlozi. News24
