Bara disciplines staff for absenteeism The Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital has disciplined 24 employees for absenteeism. Operational challenges experienced due to absenteeism include not having sufficient staff available to maintain appropriate and acceptable required service delivery standards. The hospital lost 6547 work days last year due to ill health which accounts for 0.82% of reasons for absenteeism, with abscondment accounting for 4.52%, and incapacity at 94.6% Reasons for the high levels of absenteeism are general absence without prior arrangements with supervisors, abscondment from service ultimately leading to dismissal, Ill health and the impact of the HIV pandemic, and lifestyles. Substance and alcohol abuse, in addition to habitual truancy are the observed patterns in the rates of absenteeism.
