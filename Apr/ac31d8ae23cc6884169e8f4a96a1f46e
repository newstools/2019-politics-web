Speaker Baleka Mbete continues defence of ANC-orchestrated violent protests 18 April 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) has received a letter from the Speaker of the National Assembly, Baleka Mbete, rejecting the Party’s request to for an Ad-Hoc Joint Committee on the spate of violent “shutdown” protests across DA-led municipalities. The DA is of the view that Parliament has a vital role to play in getting to the bottom of this orchestrated anarchy sponsored by the failing ANC. This rejection is therefore nothing more than an attempt to defend the ANC-orchestrated violent protest. The ANC has hijacked the legitimate plight of the people of Alexandra and other poor communities, to fuel a violent and anarchic ungovernability campaign in order to hold onto its narrow electoral prospects. The truth is that for 25 years the ANC has failed the most vulnerable people of our country. Instead of offering change, the ANC offers instability and violence. By rejecting our call for an ad-hoc joint committee meeting, Parliament has essentially condoned the ANC’s thuggery. This is no surprise, considering that the President of the Republic himself has thrown his support behind these violent shutdowns. Unlike the ANC, the DA has the political maturity to put the people of this country first. We are committed to building One South Africa for All, where every citizen has access to basic services.
