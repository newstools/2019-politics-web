DA notes the outcome of the City of Joburg Council Meeting 11 December 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) notes the outcome of today’s meeting which we have never regarded as being legal. As such, we are considering our options and are obtaining advice. We want to make one thing clear, we have no difficulty in taking up seats in opposition benches. However, two DA Councillors defied the Caucus Whip and will thus face consequences. We will continue to hold this new government accountable and fight against a return to looting and the destruction of successes achieved by 3 years of a DA-led government.
