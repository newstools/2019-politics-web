Gauteng Department of Human Settlements consistently fails to reach its housing targets 29 August 2019 The Gauteng Department of Human Settlements has once again failed to reach its own set target for the First Quarter of the 2019/20 financial year. According to the 2019/20 department’s First Quarter Performance Report they underperformed across all their targets. The table below indicates the department’s programmes, first quarter planned targets and the outcomes: Department Programme 1st Quarter planned target Outcomes Approved beneficiaries allocated to available housing units 1906 405 Approved beneficiaries allocated to available serviced sites 2427 0 Land parcels acquired for development of human settlements 1 0 Sites serviced for the Integrated Residential Development Programme (IRDP) phase one which includes planning and services for informal settlements 200 0 Sites serviced for theIRDP phase two which includes; top structure construction: informal settlements 2227 343 Houses completed forthe Integrated Residential Development Programme phase two 1906 1706 Upgrading of Community Residential Units 41 0 This clearly indicates that this department is not capable of delivering on its mandate. The reasons given for the department’s underperformance are late payments of the contractors, poor performance by the contractors and delays in the appointment of contractors. All of these relate to project management, of which it seems the department is incapable. It is completely unacceptable for the department to consistently underperform yet no one is held accountable. This department is clearly not serious about delivering on its core mandate of providing houses to the people of this province. We challenge the Gauteng MEC for Human Settlements, Lebogang Maile, to walk the talk instead embarking on PR exercises.
