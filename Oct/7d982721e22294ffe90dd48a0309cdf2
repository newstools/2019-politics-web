In memoriam: Arvitha Doodnath 14 October 2019 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0'])); It is with deep regret and shock that we report the death of Arvitha Doodnath, who fell victim to an attempted hijacking, and subsequently passed away on Saturday evening, 12 October 2019. Arvitha joined the Helen Suzman Foundation as a legal researcher in 2015, and her passion for health policy reform quickly saw her take over the HSF’s health desk. After 3 years in this position, she went on to join the academic faculty at the Vaal University of Technology where she lectured her students in Policing Law. Following her departure to take up her lecturing position, she was appointed as a Research Fellow of the HSF. Arvitha maintained a close relationship with the HSF and continued to attend our events and support our work. We remember Arvitha for her unyielding passion for justice and her commitment to making a real contribution, through her work and personal life, to a better South Africa. She lived her life with fierce determination, compassion, and joy. It is devastating that her life was taken from her in the manner that it was.eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_0',113,'0','0'])); We wish to extend our deepest condolences to her family and friends for this tragic loss, to whom we offer our support and prayers. Arvitha was, and remains, an integral part of the HSF family and we will forever remember her in this way. Issued by Francis Antonie, Director, HSF, 14 October 2019
