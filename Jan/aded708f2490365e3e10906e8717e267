AfriForum offers support to Coligny Two after eyewitness admits to lying Civil rights organisation AfriForum has decided to offer legal and other aid to Pieter Doorewaard and Phillip Schutte of Coligny, after the sole eyewitness in the murder case against them, Bonakele Pakisi, admitted that he had lied in court when testifying that he had seen Doorewaard and Schutte killing a teenager, Matlhomola Moshoeu. This offer follows after the Sunday paper Rapport today revealed that Pakisi had admitted to two people that he had lied in court and that his confession had been recorded. AfriForum has already made the offer of support to the legal representative of Doorewaard and Schutte and will continue discussions in this regard this week. According to Kallie Kriel, CEO of AfriForum, his organisation would not only like to ensure that Doorewaard and Schutte will receive all possible assistance, but also that Pakisi will face criminal prosecution for the perjury he had committed. Kriel states that it is important that all who lie in order to create and incite racial tension – thereby casting a false pall of “racism” over the heads of innocent people – should be called to account. “Just as the lives of Doorewaard and Schutte have been destroyed by lies, we have just witnessed once again in Schweizer-Reneke how racial instigators used lies and misrepresentations to disrupt the life of a competent and dedicated teacher, Elana Barkhuizen. It is high time for an example to be made of all such liars and racial instigators,” Kriel added. Statement issued by Kallie Kriel, CEO, AfriForum, 20 January 2019
