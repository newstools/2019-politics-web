Molefe’s review application failed – Solidarity 24 April 2019 Former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe’s application for leave to appeal was dismissed for the third time with a punitive cost order. This followed after Molefe submitted a review application on 1 November. Earlier, on 5 October 2018, the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein dismissed with costs Molefe’s application to appeal against the earlier High Court ruling. Deon Reyneke, Deputy General Secretary of the Energy Industry at Solidarity, said the fact that Molefe’s applications to appeal have failed every time is proof that he has no chance of success. “Molefe is painting himself into a corner in an attempt to circumvent the law, and one can only hide behind court processes for so long,” Reyneke said.
