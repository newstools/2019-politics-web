Presiding Officers of Parliament saddened by passing of Deputy Minister Hlongwa 14 September 2019 Parliament, Saturday,  14 September 2019 - The Presiding Officers of Parliament, National Assembly Speaker Ms Thandi Modise and National Council of Provinces Chairperson Mr Amos Masondo, have expressed shock and deep sadness on the news of the passing of Member of Parliament and Deputy Minister, Ms Bavelile Hlongwa. Deputy Minister Hlongwa passed away tragically in a car accident on Friday. Ms Hlongwa, one of the new Members of Parliament and the National Executive, brought great energy and remarkable enthusiasm to the new administration's endeavor to radically change the quality of lives of South Africans. As a qualified chemical engineer and experienced leader who rose through both political, public and corporate ranks, she fitted like a glove in her portfolio in the Mineral Resources and Energy Department and infused necessary youthful energy in driving this important sector of our economy. "The passing of such a young talented and vibrant leader with incredible sharp mind and clarity of thought, who was genuinely dedicated to the course of social and economic transformation of the people, is a devastating loss not only to Parliament and Government but the entire nation. The future and the hopes of this country rests on the shoulders of such capable, experienced and educated young leaders to contribute in intensifying and taking forward quality public service to the people. In this regard, much was still expected of this young woman leader." "On behalf of the leadership of Parliament, we extend our heartfelt sympathies to Deputy Minister Hlongwa's family, friends and her comrades in the African National Congress," said the Speaker and the Chaiperson. As ordered by the President, the national flag shall also fly at half-mast at the Houses of Parliament until the Deputy Minister is laid to rest.
