Members of the SANEF Management Committee and the editor of the Sunday World, Makhudu Sefara, a SANEF member, were in attendance. Mantashe was accompanied by his special advisors, chief of staff & media liaison officer. The meeting was robust and difficult as the events of the past 5 days were discussed. As SANEF we reiterated the damage the allegations have done to not only the Sunday World but to the whole industry. “Paid for” or so-called “brown envelope” is gutter journalism, and an assault to media ethics. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));The new editor-in-chief of the Sunday World, Makhudu Sefara explained that the allegations have created a reputational crisis for the weekly paper. The Minister’s initial statement that he bribed journalists and then his withdrawal of this claim has threatened the invaluable trust relationship necessary between the publication and readers - but also amongst the Sunday World and its journalists. Sefara has been forced to subject all his staff to lie-detector tests. After the robust discussion, Minister Mantashe confirmed the following: eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));- That he had stated that he had bribed journalists – confirming that the statements attributed to him in the Sunday World were correct. - He however denied bribing journalists. He insists there was never a meeting with the paper’s journalists and an exchange of money. - He, however, said that he will subject himself to the full processes of the Kathy Satchwell Inquiry into Media Ethics and Credibility to explain the circumstances that led to him making the statement. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0']));SANEF chairperson, Mahlatse Mahlase requested that the Minister apologise to the nation, journalists at Sunday World, and the industry for the damage, pain and confusion he has caused by making the serious allegations that he had bribed journalists. “Our reporters feel he must apologise not just to the paper, but for causing pain and trauma in their lives, Sefara said. As SANEF we reiterated the damage the allegations have done to not only the Sunday World but to the entire industry. “Paid for” or so-called “brown envelope” Journalism is gutter journalism, and an assault to media ethics. SANEF urges the Minister that when he approaches the Satchwell commission he makes a statement under oath.
