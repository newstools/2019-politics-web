Gauteng’s 4.9 million unemployed cannot get ahead under the ANC 30 July 2019 Figures released today by StatsSA indicate that unemployment in Gauteng is soaring to unprecedented levels. The current expanded unemployment figure, which also includes those who have given up looking for work sits at 35%, or 4.9 million people. Year-on-year, 196 000 more people in Gauteng find themselves in the grip of unemployment, unable to provide for themselves or their families. The reasons behind the massive increase in joblessness can be solely laid at the feet of the ANC-led Gauteng Provincial Government. Their out of touch reality was exemplified by ANC Secretary General, Ace Magashule who admitted that only now has the party woken up to the realisation that unemployment is skyrocketing. Policy uncertainty, a lack of support for SMMEs, poorly run entities like the Gauteng Enterprise Propellor and poor financial administration within government departments have all contributed to this dismal state of affairs. This clearly shows that under the ANC, in spite of its so-called Transformation, Modernization and Re-Industrial programme it has not instilled the confidence in the private sector to invest, and has not created an environment conducive to economic growth. The DA will continue to ensure that it plays an active role in holding this government to account and provide viable, realistic plans to stimulate economic growth and create jobs.
