The plot that failed to destroy the ATM 1 July 2019 The ATM notes, with disbelief but without surprise, the unfolding media reports of the ‘plot’ to destroy the party, attributed to the ANC. Following these disturbing revelations, the ATM had no choice but to embark on its own investigation without delay. We are pleased with the early successes of our investigations. We confirm being in possession of authentic recordings, provided by sources known to the ATM, in line with the Sunday Independent report. High profile people are implicated in these recordings. ATM is consulting its lawyers for advice. Already, the ATM has instigated a R22million damages claim against Mr Ngqulwana. More action will follow. The ATM is founded by people of integrity, and on sound principles and lasting values. The ATM will prevail, and will develop into a mighty political force for the direct benefit of all South Africans. Nothing, and nobody, will deter the ATM from its stated objective to put South Africa first by peace, Ubuntu, transformation, servant leadership, and accountability.
