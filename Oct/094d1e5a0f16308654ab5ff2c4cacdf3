Etzebeth has been accused of using a racial slur when he and a group of friends were at a Langebaan pub on the West Coast in August this year. The incident also involved two men allegedly being pistol-whipped, News24 reported. The Bok lock has denied the allegations, and has filedÂ strongly wordedÂ court papers in the Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg, saying the case the SAHRC had brought against him in the Equality Court was "unlawful". The term of incumbent Deputy Public Protector Kevin Malunga comes to an end in December. News24
