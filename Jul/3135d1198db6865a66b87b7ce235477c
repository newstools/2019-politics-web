AfriForum forces Tshwane Metro to negotiation table 9 July 2019 The civil rights organisation AfriForum met with the Tshwane Metro at the urgent court today regarding the increased electricity tariff that the Metro implemented without the approval of the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa). This follows after senior management of the Metro invited the organisation to convene before the urgent court application. According to Morné Mostert, AfriForum’s Head of Local Government Affairs, it is important to take note that the Metro asked AfriForum to make proposals to the tariff, especially regarding the structural change. “The Metro confirmed to AfriForum that an adjustment would be made to any person’s account that is billed incorrectly. An instruction was also given that normal users would not receive accounts before the dispute about the implemented electricity tariff has been cleared up.” Mostert adds that AfriForum still views the case as a priority and will continue to oppose the case should a reasonable electricity tariff increase, which complies with the necessary processes and approval from Nersa, not be placed on the table. “We still view this case as urgent and will apply pressure to the Metro to protect the rights of our members.” Issued by Carina Bester, Media Relations Officer, AfriForum, 9 July 2019
