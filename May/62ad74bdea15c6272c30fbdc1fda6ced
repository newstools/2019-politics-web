ANC STATEMENT ON THE WITHDRAWAL AND RE-ASSIGNMENT OF CDE NOMVULA MOKONYANE The African National Congress (ANC) is in receipt of a request by Cde Nomvula Mokonyane to reconsider her deployment to the 6th Parliament as House Chairperson. The deployment was finalized by the National Officials and announced on Monday. Comrade Nomvula has since advised the ANC that due to family responsibilities and her being in mourning currently, she believes she would be unable to diligently and with commitment, fulfil her duties at this stage as a Member of the 6th Parliament. The ANC will accordingly reassign Comrade Nomvula to its Head Quarters at Luthuli House. Statement issued by Ace Magashule, ANC Secretary General, 22 May 2019
