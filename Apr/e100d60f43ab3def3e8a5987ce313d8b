Former ANC employee back in court for cash heist charges 3 April 2019 Former ANC employee Errol Velile Present, who is facing charges related to a cash-in-transit heist, is expected to appear in the Roodepoort Regional Court on Wednesday. Present and his three co-accused will be in the dock again after being arrested in July last year. Present, who was based at the party's Luthuli House headquarters, was arrested in connection with a Dobsonville cash heist and was charged with armed robbery, possession of a hijacked motor vehicle and attempted murder. During their bail application, it was alleged that Present was the getaway driver and had driven a hijacked vehicle fleeing the scene with an estimated R200 000 in cash. In September 2018, the 33-year-old Present and his three co-accused - Itumeleng Manama, 40, Bheki Biyela, 38, and Zakhele Zondi, 37 - were granted bail of R4 000 each. While Present has no previous convictions, the court heard during the bail application that there was a warrant for his arrest for failing to appear before the Orlando Magistrate's Court for reckless driving. His co-accused, however, all have previous convictions. News24
