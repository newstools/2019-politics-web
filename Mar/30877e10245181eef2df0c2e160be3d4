ICASA chairperson should be removed immediately – Committee 12 March 2019 The Portfolio Committee on Communications, having considered the conviction and sentencing of the Chairperson of the Council of the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA), Mr Ruben Mohlaloga, has adopted a resolution that he be removed in terms of section 8 of the ICASA Act. The Chairperson of the committee, Prof Hlengiwe Mkhize, said: “Having deliberated on the issue of the chairperson of ICASA, the committee has once more emphasised that he should be removed as a chairperson and also removed as council member of ICASA, as it is in the Act of ICASA that a person who is found guilty cannot hold the position of a councillor.” Mr Mohlaloga was sentenced to an effective 20-year imprisonment for money laundering and fraud by the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in Pretoria, Gauteng. The committee has since taken this decision, but allowed Mr Mohlaloga an opportunity to make representations on why he should not be removed, wherein, among other things, he indicated that he would be launching an appeal to his conviction. On the other hand, the committee was briefed by the management of the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) and the Minister of Communications on the progress with regard to the turnaround strategy, labour relations issues, and the implementation on the recommendations of the Ad Hoc Committee on SABC Board Inquiry. Prof Mkhize commended the good cooperation between the management of SABC and the Minister, saying that working together, the parties will be able to come out with a sustainable funding model for the public broadcaster.
