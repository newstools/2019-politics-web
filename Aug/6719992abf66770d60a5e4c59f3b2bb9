DA welcomes suspension of Mamusa Municipal Manager and CFO 1 August 2019 The Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes the suspension of Mamusa Local Municipality’s Municipal Manager (MM), Mokgatlhe Ratlhogo, and the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Itumeleng Lekawa, by the newly appointed Administrator, Charmaine Perreira. The DA was informed that the administrator was made aware of large scale corruption within the municipality which led to the subsequent seizure of municipal computers as part of a forensic investigation. The MM was appointed irregularly by the former Mayor Aaron Motswana and under their leadership, the municipality was plagued by gross financial mismanagement and a lack of service delivery leading to the municipality being placed under Section 139 (1)(b) administration. Last year 2018, Motswana survived a motion of no confidence that was brought against him and refused to resign from the position claiming that he was targeted for being in the so-called Supra camp. Mamusa Local Municipality is currently without a Mayor after Motswana was appointed as a member of the North West Provincial Legislature serving as the Chairperson of Cooperative Governance Portfolio Committee. The ANC continues to show that it is not serious about stopping corruption nor improving service delivery, they are more interested in looting state coffers and cadre deployment. Mamusa Local Municipality remains plagued by ANC mismanagement, infighting and factionalism and fails to deliver the most basic services to people. The DA will continue to play its oversight role and monitor the provincial intervention process within the municipality to ensure that it addresses issues of corruption and improves service delivery. The people of Mamusa have suffered for far too long under an uncaring ANC government. Only the DA can bring change that will stop corruption and speed up service delivery to improve the lives of residents. Issued by Joe McGluwa, DA NW Provincial Leader, 1 August 2019
