DA welcomes action on abuse at Mamelodi Hospital 3 June 2019 The Democratic Alliance welcomes the disciplinary action against four staff members implicated in the horrific abuse of an elderly woman at the Mamelodi Hospital, but further steps are needed to eradicate the deep rot at this hospital. According to a preliminary report, 76-year-old Martha Marais was chained for eight hours on the freezing cold floor under steel benches. Two doctors and a nurse, as well as a security guard, have been placed on special leave and will have to give reasons why they should not be suspended. It boggles the mind how any medical professional could be involved in this callous treatment of a frail patient. The hospital’s top management should also be held accountable as something like this could only happen in a general culture of poor service and contempt for the dignity of patients. I support the Marais family’s decision to lay an assault charge against those responsible. Enough is enough! Our hospitals should be places of healing not places where patients are abused by uncaring staff. Issued by Jack Bloom, DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC, 3 June 2019
