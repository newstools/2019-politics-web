AfriForum submits complaint at SAHRC over racist comments in wake of Hoërskool Driehoek tragedy 4 February 2019 The civil rights organisation AfriForum submitted complaints against 24 individuals to the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) following racist and inciting comments made on social media in the wake of the tragedy at Hoërskool Driehoek. Four learners died and 21 more were injured on Friday 1 February 2019 when a walkway at the school collapsed. Some of the racist remarks include: “Don’t have heart to feel pain for three white kids. Minus 3 future problems” – Siyanda Dizzy Gumede “Minus 3 future land criminals” – Neo Kgante “If they're white its not so sad. They have been reunited with their Apartheid grannies in hell. Fewer voters for AfriForum Hooray [sic]” – Ndingu Amanda Ernst Roets, Deputy CEO of AfriForum, says that the organisation is opposed to all forms of racism and that this racist behaviour is disgusting and unacceptable. "Anyone who enjoys or celebrates the death of someone (in this case children) because that person is from another race should be called to account by society. We also call on the public to openly express their condemnation against such behaviour," Roets says. Issued by Marelie Greeff, Media Relations Officer, AfriForum, 4 February 2019
