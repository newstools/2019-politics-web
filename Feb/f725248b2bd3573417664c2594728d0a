EFF STATEMENT ON THE SECRETIVE RECRUITMENT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF SARS Thursday, 14 February, 2019 The EFF is concerned about the secretive and suspicious manner in which the Minister of Finance, Tito Mboweni, is facilitating the recruitment and appointment of the Commissioner of the South African Revenue Services (SARS). We are aware of the sinister attempts to impose an incompetent and unqualified person as the new head of SARS. When he presented the report to the Standing Committee on Finance, Judge Nugent announced that it is the Commission of Inquiry that recommended a secret interview process. Justice Bernard Ngoepe immediately disagreed with Judge Nugent and emphasized that all processes to select senior public servants must be transparent. The Commision of Inquiry into SARS seems to have taken over the operations of the Revenue Collector, and this is concerning. The EFF wrote to the Minister of Finance to demand clarity on the following questions, regarding the recruitment process of the Commissioner of SARS: 1 . When was the closing date for submission of CVs by interested parties? 2. How many CVs did you receive by the closing date? 3. Who applied for the position of the Commissioner of SARS? Details by name and surnames. 4. What criteria were used to shortlist candidates for interviews? 5. Who was shortlisted for interviews? 6. Have interviews been conducted? If yes, when and where? We have requested the Minister to respond to our letter with the urgency and sensitivity it deserves, to avoid smearing the process Of appointing a Commissioner Of SARS given the history of the institution.
